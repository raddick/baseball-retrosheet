This is a description of the new records created to support "Box Score
Event Files" (BSEF).  These are intended to contain information
sufficient to create box scores and construct player dailies for games
that are missing complete play-by-play-accounts.

These BSEF are marked by a file name extension of ".eba" and ".ebn" that
distinguish them from AL event files (.eva) and NL event files (.evn).

The header of the event file (the portion of the file from the "id"
record until the end of the "start" records) will be unchanged.  The
version record for these files will read:

version,3

to differentiate this game from ones without these new records.

The new record types below may appear in any order.  In addition, all
sequence information within record types is explicitly described in
each record and is not implied by its order in the file.

The new record types:


stat,bline - a record describing a player's batting and base-running data
for the game.

Syntax:

stat,bline,id,side,pos,seq,ab,r,h,2b,3b,hr,rbi,sh,sf,hbp,bb,ibb,k,sb,cs,gidp,int

Where:

  id - the player ID
  side - the side he appeared for (0 or 1)
  pos - the position in the lineup (1 to 9)

        will equal 1.  For players replacing the starter, this field will
        equal 2 and so on.
  ab...int - the player's statistics for the game.  Almost all of the
             abbreviations should be obvious.  int - reached base on
             interference.
