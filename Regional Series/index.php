<h2>Regional Postseason Series</h2>
<p>
In the first half of the 20th Century, there were 32 "City Series" sanctioned by major league
baseball that followed the format of the World Series. Like the World Series, major league
baseball received a portion of the gate, the winning players received more than the losing
players, and the scheduled games after the series was decided were not played. 75% of these
series were between the Chicago teams. The Chicago series was the only one to be played after
World War I. A few of the series were not between teams sharing the same city. There were
three Ohio series between Cincinnati and Cleveland and lone series between Pittsburgh and
Cleveland and the Red Sox and Giants.
<p>
Michael Cantor has worked for over 15 years putting together the most detailed information about
these series and has generously provided his work to Retrosheet. We are pleased to make
available to the baseball community the fruits of his efforts. His article about the history
of these series, which is linked below, includes a listing of ones not played under the auspices
of the major leagues from 1903-16 and references to other sources about these series.
Mike has provided play-by-play accounts of more than 80% of the 190 games played in these series.
We have made Retrosheet game account pages from them, and they are linked to the series summary
pages. We have posted deduced accounts or box scores for the other games. In many cases, his
research resulted in corrections of errors in the accounts he found in newspapers.

Fred Ivor-Campbell wrote an article "City Series" for the first edition of <i>Total Baseball</i>,
which was published in 1989. The article was not in any later editions. It covers series as far
back as 1882 and provides a brief synopsis of each one. All of the ones listed below except for
the 1909 Red Sox-Giants and 1913 Indians-Pirates are in the article. Mike Cantor has written
stories about those two series, which are linked to the series summaries. Retrosheet has been
given permission to reproduce Fred's article.

<p>Eric Weiss has put together the rosters for the series below except for the 1917 St. Louis series. As a
bonus the 1912 Philadelphia series, which was not officially sanctioned, is also included. These rosters
support research into the series by listing all players eligible for each series, whether or not they actually played in the series, and in some cases, did not appear for the team during the regular season.

<b>Additions, Changes, Corrections:</b> Although we took great care to make the information
shown as accurate as we could, for several reasons, most significantly that all of the games
were played more than two-thirds of a century ago, there likely are some mistakes. We will
show any changes here. If you discover anything you think we should know about, please send
an e-mail to the webmaster: retro2 --ATsign-- pankin.com
