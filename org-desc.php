Retrosheet Organizational Description
<p>
Modern baseball analysis has grown increasingly sophisticated in the
past decade and a number of new statistical categories have come into
common usage among announcers and writers.  All of these new methods
require detailed play by play data for current games and several
statistical organizations actively collect this information.  Many
fans would like to compare modern player performances to those from
earlier this century but have been unable to do so, since play by
play accounts have never been collected or organized in a systematic
way.  Therefore, a new organization, called Retrosheet, was founded
in 1989 for the purpose of computerizing play by play accounts of
as many pre-1984 major league games as possible (data for games since
1984 are available through the Project Scoresheet-Baseball Workshop
database).
<p>
Retrosheet's work has three distinct aspects.  First is the collection
of the game accounts, which have been obtained from several sources.
The bulk of the collection has come from the major league teams, who have
allowed us to make copies of their play-by-play 
accounts.  Several sportswriters (most of them retired) have allowed
copies to be made of their daily scorebooks.  In addition, individual
fans have donated copies of games they scored at the park or on their
own scoresheets at home.  The second activity is the translation of
these accounts to a unified, modern system which is essential since
there are an extraordinary variety of scoring systems which have been
used.  The final activity is the entry of the translated accounts
into the computer.
<p>
Retrosheet has been very successful in the collection of game accounts
with more than 100,000 currently in hand.  A group of some 100 volunteers
is actively involved in the translation work and the computer entry.
However, the task ahead is enormous and we are always looking for more
volunteers; any offers of help are greatly appreciated.  Baseball fans
interested in this historical effort are invited to volunteer their
assistance in the translation and inputting efforts as well as to make
available copies of game accounts they might have.
<p>
The ultimate objective of Retrosheet is to make this basic play by
play information publicly available for all interested researchers.
Several methods for data distribution will be followed, including
depositing the material in the Hall of Fame Library in Cooperstown.
