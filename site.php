      tempted to call it the Retrosheet Encyclopedia because there is so much 
      here. However, we don't want you to think it is just another encyclopedia 
      because we don't have some of the items in the traditional ones and we 
      have information that you just won't find anywhere else. Explore the 
      seemingly countless number of links to discover the treasures that await 
      you. Included are:

<li>Pre-integration interracial games
<li>Box score and event files downloads
</ul>


<P><FONT size=4>Data downloads</FONT><BR>
<ul>
<li>Play-by-play files (also called event files) -- Data 
      files containing literally every play in the included games. The files are 
      designed to be processed further using your own computer. We provide some 
      software to help and some documentation about the files and 
      the software. If you are looking for instant 
      information on-line, these files are not for you. Instead, look in 
      Boxscores'n'more.
<li>Game logs -- Basic data for every major league 
      game since 1871, the first year of major league play, including date, score,
      winning and losing pitchers, and a 
      lot more. What's available varies by years (less for the earlier years, 
      more for the later years). Read the descriptive text file for an 
      explanation of what is there. These are data files designed for input into 
      a database or spreadsheet program, so they probably won't make much sense 
      when seen on your screen.
<li>Schedules -- The game logs show the results of the games as they
were actually played, which includes games that were postponed, most often due to poor weather,
and played later or in a few cases were never made up. The files on this page show the
schedules as the season began, which are of particular interest to those wanting to
replay seasons.

<li>Most wanted -- Lists of the games from 1920-73 for which we

1974 on. Obviously, we are very interested in accounts from earlier years also.

</ul>

<P><FONT size=4>Organization</FONT><BR>
<ul>
<li>Who we are -- A brief description of Retrosheet and its
history. Also, reports and pictures from each of the annual meetings since the first
one in 1994 in Arlington, Texas as well as a listing of the members of Board of Directors
and pictures of that group at various times.
<li>Discussion group -- The RetroList list server is on the Yahoo!Groups
site. In addition to providing information about and commenting on this web site, Retrosheet
volunteers and other interested fans also exchange comments about a variety of
not-so-common baseball topics such as interpretation of scoring rules and raise questions,
usually getting quick answers, about the availability and accuracy of historical data. Typically
there are fewer than ten messages a day. There is a link to sign up if you are interested.
<li>Donations -- Retrosheet has been classified by the IRS as a
501(c)(3) charitable and educational organization, so donations are fully tax-deductible.
We accept donations, which are primarily used to support acquistion of materials vital to
our collection and proofing of historical data. PayPal can be used if desired.

</ul>

<P><FONT size=4>Archives</FONT><BR>
<ul>
<li>Newsletters -- This 
      page contains the Retrosheet newsletters that were published until early 
      2002. The page also contains information about the publicity Retrosheet has
      received in the media. Although the primary purpose of the 
      newsletters was keeping Retrosheet volunteers up to date, others will most 
      definitely find a great deal of interesting materials. As we have culled 
      through old newspapers looking for game accounts, we have run across many 
      baseball curiosities, some of which are quite funny or startling. The 
      newsletters also have some analysis and data, such as how Stan Musial 
      performed at Ebbets Field. Every baseball fan will enjoy browsing 
      them.
<li>Site history -- Some of the items in the What's New section
of our home page are things that would have been appropriate for the newsletters we
used to publish. An example is a report on the Board of Directors meeting held at
the 2002 Society for Baseball Research (SABR) national convention. We collect these
type of items and a few others in the Archives when they are taken out of the What's New section.
