<H2>Batting Out of Turn</H2>
<P>Occasionally, a player will bat out of turn according to the lineup provided 
to the umpires by the manager before the game. This can cause great confusion on 
the part of the managers and umpires trying to decide what to do about the 
mistake. Rule 6.07 discusses at great length the concept of batting out of turn. 
Rule 10.03 (d) discusses the scoring of such plays. If the team at bat does not 
gain by the illegal action, the opposing manager usually says nothing. However, 
when that illegal batter does advance the cause of his team by advancing or 
scoring a runner, then it is time to speak out. This is not always done, 
however, since many times the opponents are unaware of the mistake.

<p>Our research page has a presentation given at SABR in 2019 that explains the
rule in addition to discussing its history, some reasons why it happens, and a few of
the more interesting instances. It also explains that there are times when teams
should not point out that the wrong batter has just reached base. See

(BOOT): The Most Confounding Rule</a>

<P>The order in which batters hit in the early years of major league play could 
be quite different from the current rules. For more information see <A

<P>Here are the instances of this event that we know:</P>
<P>Links to boxscores and play-by-play accounts where available by clicking on 
the date 
<P>
<p><u>9/15/1881</u> - Davy Force of the Buffalo Bisons was called out in a game at
Worcester. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>6/6/1882</u> - The Buffalo Bisons were in Providence to play the Grays.
Pitcher Pud Galvin was listed as batting eighth for the Bisons with Tom Dolan in the
ninth spot in the order. In the second inning, Dolan batted in Galvin's spot and
singled. Umpire Joe Quinn called Galvin out but allowed the single to stand.
The Grays won the contest, 15-7.

<p><u>7/10/1883</u> - The Buffalo Bisons hosted the New York Gothams, whose official line up had Frank Hankinson hitting
7th and Tip O'Neill, the pitcher hitting 8th. In the second inning, they batted in the opposite order and both made outs, so
Buffalo did not protest. O'Neill again batted out of order in the 4th when he made the third out. As Hankinson came up to lead off the 5th Buffalo protested. The umpire, Stewart Decker, sent Hankinson off the field and had O'Neill, who was a weaker
hitter, bat again without anyone being called out. Under current rules, the number nine hitter, Dasher Troy, would have been
allowed to bat without penalty.

<p><u>7/14/1884</u> - The Buffalo Bisons were in Cleveland playing the Blues when in the bottom of the first the Sam Moffet, led off for Cleveland. He doubled, but he was the number eight hitter on the official lineup card. He was declared out. Under today's rules, the correct lead off hitter, Bill Phillips, would have been called out.

<p><u>5/21/1887</u> - Mike Morrison of the Cleveland Blues was called out in a home game against the Philadelphia Athletics. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>6/1/1887</u> - The Louisville Colonels were playing in Philadelphia against the Athletics when Lave Cross batted out of order and made outs in the second and fifth innings. In the seventh, he singled and this time Philadelphia pointed out that he was not the proper batter. However, Ned Cuthbert, the umpire ruled that since he had been allowed to bat out of order twice, that the protest was denied. There was nothing in the rule of the time that allowed for that ruling.

<p><u>7/21/1887</u> - The Chicago White Sox batting order in Boston against the Beaneaters had Mark Baldwin hitting 8th and Tom Daly 9th. The first time through the order they batted in reverse order. The second time through with two out Daly again hit before Baldwin and reached second on two errors. After the first pitch, a ball, was thrown to Baldwin, Boston protested, and after some discussions by the umpires and the teams' captains, Phil Powers ruled Baldwin out for batting out of order. He was not the proper batter as the lead off man would have been under today's rules. The rule in place at the time was as clear as the current one, but under both Chicago should have been able to put the proper batter up with a 1-0 count.

<p><u>9/15/1887</u> - The NY Giants were in Chicago playing the White Stockings (now Cubs). Jim O'Rourke was listed twice in the batting order. The first was "O'Rourke or Brown, catcher" and the second was "Nelson or O'Rourke, third base." In the second inning, O'Rourke was out at 1B batting out of order but nothing was said. In the fourth, he hit a home run into the carriages beyond the outfielders but was called out after Chicago manager Cap Anson appealed to umpire Phil Powers.

<p><u>9/16/1887</u> - The Indianapolis Hoosiers lineup for their home game against the
Philadelphia Quakers has the pitcher Lev Shreve batting eighth and the catcher John "Tug"
Arundel ninth. At one point in the game Arundel batted ahead of Shreve and John Valentine
correctly called Shreve out. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>7/18/1889</u> - The Philadelphia Phillies were hosting the Pittsburgh Alleghenys. The home team elected to bat
first and scored three runs in the top of the first. In the bottom of the first, Pittsburgh had a man on first and
two outs with the number four hitter, Al Maul, due to bat. However, James "Deacon" White, the number five batter
in the lineup hit a double that scored the runner. The Phillies appealed, and Tom Lynch, the umpire, correctly
called Maul out to end the inning without the run counting.

<p><u>4/18/1890</u> - The Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association
won 12-9 at home against the Rochester Hop Bitters. According to the boxscore in
the Philadelphia Inquirer the next day, Wilbert Robinson of the Athletics
batted out of turn, but <span style='color:red'>the story about the game had no additional information</span>.

<p><u>5/30/1890</u> - In the first game of the Memorial Day double header, Henry Gruber
of the Cleveland Infants was called out for batting out of order in the Players League
game in Brooklyn against the Wonders. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>6/28/1890</u> - Less than a month later, the Brooklyn Wonders batted out of turn
against the Cleveland Infants in Cleveland. Although he batted in the proper order in the
second inning when Brooklyn scored five runs, and presumably again before the fifth, Paul
Cook batted out of order in that inning.<span style='color:red'> No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>5/7/1891</u> - The Brooklyn Bridegrooms lineup in its home game against Philadelphia
had the pitcher William "Adonis" Terry batting eighth followed by the catcher Tom Kinslow.
However, Kinslow made the last out of the first inning batting ahead of Terry. Terry started
the second inning with a double and was called out when Philadelphia pointed out the correct batting order.

<p><u>6/17/1891</u> - The Colts (now Cubs) played in Cleveland. Through the seventh
inning, the Colts' Bill Hutchinson batted in Malachi Kittridge's place in the batting
order but the Spiders let it go. In the seventh, Fred Pfeffer walked and Hutchinson,
batting out of turn, singled, moving Pfeffer to third. As Kittridge stepped to the
plate, the Spiders told umpire Tim Lynch that Hutchinson batted out of turn. This
out ended the inning, killing the Colts' rally. 

<p><u>6/19/1891</u> - Dick Johnston of Cincinnati Kelly's Killers (AA) was called out
in this game against the Louisville Colonels. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>9/2/1891</u> - The Phillies were visiting Pittsburgh when they had two players
called out for batting out of turn. Manager Harry Wright listed Billy
Shindle sixth in the batting order and Ed Mayer eighth. In the second
inning, Mayer batted in Shindle's place because that was how the order had
been the day before. After Mayer struck out, Pirates manager Bill McGunnigle
talked with umpire Jack McQuaid about the Phillies batting out of order.
McQuaid declared Shindle and William Brown (in the seventh spot) out for
allowing Mayer to bat ahead of them.

<p><u>9/10/1891</u> - Bill Dahlen of the Chicago Colts was called out for batting
out of turn in the first inning of the game in Philadelphia against the Phillies.
<span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>9/29/1891</u> - According to the Milwaukee Sentinel, John Carney of the
American Association Milwaukee Brewers was out in the top of the second for
batting out of turn in a 10-5 loss at home against the Louisville Colonels.
<span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>4/30/1892</u> - In a game in Louisville, in the first Brooklyn had three
runs in with one out and the bases empty with the number five hitter due up.
However, William Darby O'Brien, number six in the order hit. He walked, stole
a base, and scored on a passed ball. At that point, his batting out of turn was
discovered (we don't have the details), and he was called out.

<p><u>5/5/1892</u> - The Phillies were in Pittsburgh. Before the game, a preprinted
scorecard from the previous day was posted in the Philadelphia dugout showing Lave
Cross batting sixth and Joe Mulvey batting seventh. However, the two had been switched
by manager Harry Wright. The two players batted in the order specified on the scorecard
(out of turn). In the top of the fourth, Mulvey singled and was called out. The Pirates won
the contest, 5-2.<br>

<p><u>7/4/1892</u> - In the first game of a holiday double header in Chicago, the Giants
catcher, Jack Boyle has hurt by a foul tip in the first inning and had to leave the game.
The starting shortstop, Jack Doyle, who was batting in the number five spot took over as
catcher while Abram Hardy Richardson went to short and hit in Boyle's number seven slot.
In the second game, Richardson and Doyle reversed with the former hitting fifth and the
latter seventh. Apparently, they did not pick up on the switch because Doyle came up in
the first with two outs and flied out. Richardson was called out since he was the proper
batter. We do not know how it was pointed out the Doyle was out of order. The Colts had
no reason to do it since Doyle had made an out. The umpire, Tom Lynch who had more than
four years of experience might should not have acted on his own, but perhaps he did.
According to the Chicago Tribune, Doyle batted first in the next inning. However, the
proper batter to lead off once Richardson is ruled out is the number six hitter, Denny
Lyons.

<p><u>10/3/1892</u> - The Louisville Colonels visited Pittsburgh to play the Pirates.
Sometime during the game, Lou Bierbauer of the Pirates was called out for batting
out of turn. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>10/7/1892</u> - The St. Louis Browns were playing in Cleveland against the Spiders
when this puzzling one happened. We have found only a brief story that said with
Cleveland ahead 8-3 in the fifth inning and it was starting to rain, the Spiders
George Davis intentionally batted out of turn in order to make the third out of the
inning quickly. The game ended after five innings because of the rain.
There are a couple of reasons for it being puzzling. We don't know if
Cleveland was batting last since in those days the home teams sometimes elected to bat
first so they could hit against the new ball in the first. If they were batting last,
it was already an official game due to a rule revision for the 1892 season. The original
1876 rule required five full innings to be played for a game to count. However,
the Spiders may not have known about the new rule. The batting out of turn rule in
effect was the original one from 1876, and it said in effect that the improper batter
would not be out until his plate appearance was completed. So a Cleveland hitter could
have just swung and missed at the first three pitches to make a quick out. The umpire
of the game was John Gaffney, who was quite experienced. However, perhaps he was not
fully versed on the rule and ruled Davis out after a pitch had been thrown and maybe
Davis pointed out that he was not the proper batter. We will try to get more information
about the game.

<p><u>5/24/1893</u> - The St. Louis Browns were in Pittsburgh playing the Pirates.
The Browns scored two runs in the ninth and lost the game 8-7. According to the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Joe Gunson made his first appearance and batted out of turn.
That paper did not have a box score for the game. However, the boxes in three other
papers and a brief mention in the Boston Globe indicated that Gunson was a pinch
hitter for the pitcher, and as such he was not batting out of turn.

<p><u>6/30/1893</u> - The New York Giants order for the game in Chicago had
William "Shorty" Fuller hitting in the eight spot followed by George Davies. In
the second, the Giants manager, Monte Ward, incorrectly told Davies to bat before
Fuller. Fuller hit next and was called out for batting out of turn.

<p><u>7/6/1893</u> - The New York Giants difficulties batting in the correct order
arose again just six days later. In a game at Louisville in which the home team
was batting first, Michael "King" Kelly replaced Jocko Milligan at catcher in
the top of the ninth. In
the bottom of the ninth, the number five hitter, Jack Doyle, was due to lead off,
but Kelly who had replaced Milligan in the number six spot came up instead. He
struck out, but the umpire Ed Seward, who had a bad day according to newspaper
stories, allowed the out stand and also called Doyle out. Given the batting out
of turn was being enforced, the correct call was to call Doyle out and have Kelly
bat again. The next hitter reached third on a single and error, but the following
one made the third out. The wrong ruling may have cost the Giants the game. It
ended as an 11-11 tie after nine innings due to darkness.

<p><u>8/1/1893</u> - In the first game of the day, Tommy Dowd was called out for
batting out of turn for the St. Louis Browns at home against the Pirates. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>9/8/1893</u> - Pop Schriver of the Chicago Colts (Cubs) was called out in a
contest against the Phillies. <span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>6/8/1894</u> - This was another time the rule was applied incorrectly to the
detriment of the team. The St. Louis
Browns were playing the Beaneaters in Boston, and the home team elected to bat first. In
the bottom of the first, the lead off batter, Tommy Dowd, walked. The next batter due up
was Frank Shugart, but the number three hitter, Charlie Frank, came up instead and struck
out. Shugart hit into a fielders choice with Dowd being put out. Boston then pointed out
that Frank had batted out of order, and the umpire, Bob Emslie, incorrectly called Frank out
ending the inning. Frank had already made an out, so it made no sense to call him out again.
The original 1876 rule, which was in effect in 1894, was poorly written and incomplete, but
it did not allow for a batter to be out twice when he batted out of order. More importantly,
Frank was not the proper batter when he hit, so the proper batter then, Shugart, should have
been called out, but he was allowed to bat. Apparently, some umpires interpreted the rule
in a different manner.

<p><u>8/12/1895</u> - In the top of the first in a game at Boston, The Washington Nationals had
two on and two out when the proper number five hitter was Win Mercer. However, Bill Hassamaer,
tbe number six hitter, came up out of order. After he fouled off a pitch, Boston pointed out
the mistake to the umpire, George Burnham. He called Mercer out to end the inning, but since
the Hassamaer at bat was not completed, that was incorrect. He should have allowed Mercer to
bat taking on the current count. Washington played the game under protest, and Boston won 4-3
in ten innings. The National League upheld the protest and ruled that the game did not count
and had to be replayed.

<p><u>9/4/1895</u> - John Dolan, the starting pitcher for the Chicago Colts (Cubs) in a game
in Boston batted out of turn, most likely in the second inning, and an out was called.
<span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.

<p><u>6/29/1897</u> - This game played in Louisville had at least examples of confusion.
The Colonels were batting first in this game, and in the top of the third the Chicago
Colts had Tom Delahanty replace Abbie Johnson at second base. Delahanty was supposed to
lead off in the bottom of the inning, but the pitcher, Jim Jones, batted and apparantly
made an out since there was no protest. It looks like l,ater in the game, Fred Clarke, who
played for Louisville also batted out of turn (<span style='color:red'>No further details are known</span>.)
Adding to the confusion after another inning, Chicago took the field after making only two outs.
The umpire called out one of the Colts to provide a third out. Since the Colts won the game
36-7, maybe they were getting tired running the bases, which may explain some of the strange
things that happened.


<p><u>5/9/1898</u> - St. Louis was playing in Cincinnati, and it manager Tim Hurst's lineup
given to home plate ump Charles Cushman had Russ Hall batting seventh and Jack Crooks
eighth. However, the lineup in the dugout had the two reversed. In the second, Crooks
came up out of order and walked. Hall then batted and sacrificed. Under the current rule,
and the rule in place then was the same according to our research, the correct batter would
have been the number nine hitter once Crooks walk was allowed to stand. The Reds protested
after Hall's sacrifice, and Cushman was apparently confused about the rule. He called Hall
out even though he was already out on the sacrifice, not the ninth spot hitter, Jim Hughey.
More amazingly, rather than sending Crooks back
to first, he had him bat again, and this time he struck out.

<p><u>5/22/1898</u> - The Chicago Orphans (now Cubs) were hosting Washington when in the
bottom of third with two outs Bill Dahlen stole second with Jimmy Ryan at bat. However,
Ryan interfered with the throw to second be jumping in front of the plate. The umpire,
Tommy Connolly called interference and apparently ruled Dahlen out. (The Chicago Tribune
story says Connolly, the only umpire due to the other one assigned refusing to work on
Sundays, had his back to the plate as he ran to call the
play at second and could not see Ryan's interference.) Ryan came up to
lead off the fourth and singled. Washington objected by pointing out the Ryan should
have been called out for interference and was batting out of order. Connolly agreed
and called Ryan out although he should have called out Sam Mertes, the batter after Ryan in
the order. All of that got the crowd upset, and eventually Connolly ejected Dahlen
who rushed out to complain.

<p><u>6/17/1898</u> - Washington was in Boston and its official lineup had Zeke Wrigley
seventh, and Bert Myers eighth. Apparently, they batted out of order in the second although
that is not desribed completely in any newspaper story we have seen. In the fourth
with a runner on second and one out, the number seven hitter was due up. Myers came
up and made an out. With the Myers play accepted by Boston, the proper next batter
was the number nine hitter, the pitcher Win Mercer.  Wrigley then came up, singled in a run, and
Bostson objected. The home plate umpire, Tom Lynch, called Wrigley out to end the
inning, not Mercer who had failed to bat when his turn came. 

<p><u>5/25/1899</u> - St. Louis hosted Brooklyn with a batting order that
was different than the usual one employed by the team. Cupid
Childs hit fourth, making an out to end the first inning. It
was Lou Criger's spot, but nothing was said about the mistake.
Bobby Wallace, the proper next batter, started the second with
a hit and then it should have been Patsy Tebeau's turn at the
plate. However, Criger hit and singled. Criger was called out
for hitting out of turn and Tebeau sent to the plate. Brooklyn
beat St. Louis, 8-1, as the home team made five errors.

<p><u>8/7/1899</u> - The New York Giants were playing at the Brooklyn Superbas,
and in the top of the second Pop Foster singled in a run. Brooklyn captain Joe Kelley
protested to the umpire, John Gaffney, that Foster had batted out of order. In fact,
Foster was not on the lineup card the umpires had because the Giants had mistakenly
given him one from a previous game. That meant other Giants had also batted out of
turn. After a considerable discussion about who was at fault and what should be
done, Gaffney decided to call Foster out. At that point, the Giants captain, Kid
Gleason, said he would pull his team off the field if that happened. Gafner relented,
possibly due to unrest by the fans who wanted to see a game, and let the Giants bat
in the order they wanted. Brooklyn protested the game, a 9-3 New York win. It likely
would have been upheld, but Kelley withdrew it the following day feeling that enough
bad will had been created and he did not want to increase it.

<p><u>9/19/1899</u> - Brooklyn was playing host to the Chicago Orphans. In the
bottom of the first, John Anderson, who was in the five spot in the order came
up batting fourth ahead of Fielder Jones, the proper hitter, and singled in a run.
Chicago did not realize it, so the run which could have been canceled stood. In
the rest of the game Brooklyn batted in the proper order.

<p><u>8/17/1901</u> - In the first game of the day between Brooklyn and New York,
Frank Bowerman was playing second base and hitting sixth in the New York lineup.
However, as he was not a regular in the lineup, he went to the plate too early
in the first inning. After the third hitter, Algie McBride, reached on an error
with two out, Bowerman walked to the plate and was hit by a pitch. Fourth place
hitter Charlie Hickman, who should have hit after McBride instead of Bowerman,
made an out to end the inning and Brooklyn did not realize the two mistakes.
(Once Bowerman reached base, the proper hitter was the seventh-place batter,
John Ganzel, not Hickman.) In the second inning, New York hit correctly,
starting with the #5 hitter, Sammy Strang. Then when Bowerman came to the plate
again, Brooklyn protested to umpire Frank Dwyer. The arbiter looked at the batting
order and proclaimed Bowerman to be the proper batter and the game went on.

<p><u>7/6/1902</u> - George Yeager of the New York Giants ended the sixth inning. When the Giants came to bat in the seventh, Yeager led off in Heinie Smiths batting spot and singled. As Smith came to bat, the St. Louis fans started to make noise about the mistake. Umpire Hank O'Day called out Smith and removed Yeager from first base.

 - In the Giants' 100th victory of the season which clinched 
the National League pennant, the Reds had trouble with their lineup. Pitcher Win 
Kellum batted in place of Tommy Corcoran and struck out. When a protest was 
lodged, Corcoran was called out and Kellum batted again. 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1905/B07250BRO1905.htm">7/25/1905</A>
 - With the Cardinals in Brooklyn for the second game of 
their series, Jimmy Sheckard ended the bottom of the seventh by striking out. 
However, the same batter started the eighth with a walk but nothing was said. 
The Redbirds scored twice in the top of the ninth on a passed ball to win, 4-3. 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1905/B08110CHN1905.htm">8/11/1905</A>
 - Brooklyn was visiting Chicago. Catcher Bill Bergin struck 
out to end the fifth inning but then came up again to start the sixth. He 
singled and eventually scored but the Cubs won, 3-2. 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1906/B06040DET1906.htm">6/4/1906</A>
 - The Tigers were hosting Washington. In the top of the eighth
inning, Howard Wakefield fouled out to start the inning but then Jake Stahl
realized he was the person who was supposed to have batted. When he reported
this to umpire Tim Hurst, the latter declared Stahl out and play proceeded.
Stahl had cussed out Hurst earlier in the game and later in the eighth cussed
out base umpire Tom Connor and was ejected. Not a great day for the Washington skipper.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1908/B05250CHN1908.htm">5/25/1908</A>
 - The Cubs hit out of turn in the first inning against the Giants in Chicago. Pat Moran was listed seventh and Joe Tinker eighth in the lineup. However, when the seventh spot came up with two out in the bottom of the first, Tinker strode to the plate and made the third out. Moran then led off the bottom of the second with a single to center and eventually scored. In the third inning, the batters hit in the correct order and the Giants objected. However, umpire Bob Emslie showed John McGraw the lineup sheet and that was the end of that. The Cubs won the contest in 10 innings, 8-7.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1908/B06012CIN1908.htm">6/1/1908</A>
 - In the top of the eigth of the second game of a double header, the Cardinals
Ed Konetchy was picked off the third to end the inning with Billy Gilbert at the
plate. Gilbert should have started the top of the ninth, but Irv Higgenbothman
came up instead and singled. The Reds objected, and Gilbert was correctly called
out and Higgenbotham batted again, grounding out this time.
 
<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1908/B07020NY11908.htm">7/2/1908</A>
 - The Phillies were at the Polo Grounds to play the Giants. 
Mickey Doolan (listed as Doolin in contemporary sources) batted seventh and Red 
Dooin batted eighth. Doolan made the last out in the seventh inning but then 
came to the plate to start the eighth. Doolan grounded out and then umpire Cy 
Rigler was notified that he had batted out of turn. Rigler called Dooin out. 
Since Doolan had already made an out the Giants should have ignored the 
confusion.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1910/B05020CIN1910.htm">5/2/1910</A>
- The Cards were in Cincinnati for the make up of a postponed game. Due to an
oversight, the NL did not assign umpires for the game, so a respected local one,
Jim Maginnis, was recruited. There were some close calls in the first that upset
St. Louis manager Reger Bresnahan, and he then made a farce out of the game with
quite a few changes of fielding positions including moving pitchers into the field
and having position players pitch. In the seventh Miller Huggins who was in the
lead off spot was hit by a pitch and Bresnahan came of the bench to run for him and
then stayed in the game at catcher replacing Billy Kelly who was in the number six
spot. In the eighth Bresnahan batted in Kelly's spot, but the proper batter was
Elmer Rieger who went in to pitch and should have hit in Kelly's spot. Bresnahan
was safe on an error, but the Reds did not notice the batting out of turn, so the
play stood. The Reds won 9-4 after scoring five in the first, so it did not hurt them.
Since there Bresnahan's play was accepted, the following batter, Arnold Hauser in
the number seven spot was also out of turn since the proper batter was the number
two hitter, Jap Barbeau. There were additional cases in the top of the ninth when
Rudy Hullswitt pinch hit for Rieger in the number one spot, where Bresnahan was the
proper batter.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1910/B08161BSN1910.htm">8/16/1910</A>
- In the bottom of the seventh in Boston, Harry Smith pinch hit
for pitcher Buster Brown and singled. Rube Sellers pinch ran for Smith and
scored two batters later. These changes took place in the ninth slot in the
batting order. When Doc Miller's turn to hit came up later in the inning,
Bud Sharpe was substituted for Miller in the fourth spot in the lineup. At
the end of the inning, Sellers remained in the game as the new right
fielder, thus hitting ninth, and Chick Evens entered the contest as the new
hurler in the fourth spot in the lineup. With two out in the bottom of the
eighth, the nine spot in the order came up but Evans batted and made the
third out of the frame. He was out of order but accepted by St. Louis. This
should have reset the batting order, making Ed Abbaticchio the next proper
batter (in the fifth spot in the lineup). However, Bill Collins batted and
made an out in the first spot in the order. Three batters later, it came
around to Evans's spot again but Sellers hit in the fourth place instead.
Sellers ended the game with an out. None of these instances of batting out
of turn were protested by the St. Louis manager, Roger Bresnahan. It could
have been since no one reached base batting out of turn or it could have
been that no one on the Cardinals side of the field noticed.

<p><u>10/2/1912</u>
- At a game in Chicago the Pirates were leading 5-4 in the 
bottom of the ninth inning. Catcher Jimmy Archer, batting in the eighth spot in 
the lineup, doubled. Cy Williams ran for Archer and Wilbur Good pinch hit for 
Jimmy Lavender. Hank Robinson replaced Howie Camnitz on the mound and Dick 
Cotter was sent up to bat for Good. Cotter singled in the tying run, sending the 
game into the tenth inning, and took Archer's place as catcher. In the bottom of 
the tenth, Chicago had runners on first and second with two out and the eighth 
place in the lineup due to bat. Cotter came to the plate and singled to center 
to drive in the winning run. After the players had left the field Pirate manager 
Fred Clarke realized what had happened and sent the team's secretary to umpire 
Brick Owens to protest. Owens told the Pirates that it was too late for a 
protest since the team had left the playing field. However, NL President Tom 
Lynch upheld the protest on 10/13 and threw the game out. It was not replayed or 
completed.
 
<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1913/B05190SLA1913.htm">5/19/1913</A>
- The Yankees scored seven runs in the top of the eighth 
inning to beat the Browns, 8-6. In that inning Frank Chance ground out as a 
pinch hitter for the pitcher, Ray Fisher, who was in the ninth spot in the lineup. 
When the New Yorkers approached the bottom of the order again in the same 
inning, Chance hit in the eighth spot instead of shortstop Claud Derrick. This 
time Chance singled and knocked in two runs. St. Louis protested to umpire 
Hildebrand after the inning was over but he correctly told them that it was too 
late.

- In the top of the seventh inning in Philadelphia, Les Nunamaker
of the Red Sox pinch hit for pitcher Hugh Bedient. Nunamaker remained in the
game catching and the new hurler, Charles Hall, entered in the eighth spot
replacing starting catcher Bill Carrigan. The Sox started at the two spot in
the top of the eighth inning. After Steve Yerkes made an out, five
consecutive Boston players singled which scored two runs with one runner out
at the plate. The next hitter should have been Hall, but Nunamaker batted
out of turn and made the third out of the frame. Hooper should have started
the ninth for the Red Sox but Hall batted out of turn. (They had the eighth
and ninth place hitters reversed.) Once Hall made and out, Harry Hooper
batted out of turn and singled. He eventually scored the winning run but the
Athletics did not notice.

- The meaningless last game of the season between the Red Sox and Senators in Washington
was turned into a farce. Some players were not in their usual positions, and Senators
owner and manager, Clark Griffith, at age 43 played in his only game of the season
pitching a scoreless 8th inning and then moving to the outfield for the 9th. The
Red Sox were down 10-3 going into the top of the ninth, and the Senators started
moving players between positions, including Germany Schaefer who was primarily an
infielder, but was playing in the outfield, coming in to pitch to start the inning,
going back to the outfield so Walter Johnson, who was in the outfield, could come
in to pitch. Then Schaefer relieved Johnson, and two more pitchers followed him
as Boston scored six runs before falling 10-9. Duffy Lewis, the number four hitter,
led off the inning, and many Boston players had already headed to the showers. The
bases were empty with two outs when the number three hitter, Harry Hooper, was due
up. However, he was already in the showers. The only person on the Red Sox bench
at that point was their trainer, who was ready to bat. However, Lewis came up and
grounded out to end the game. For obvious reasons, the Senators did not object.

- Gavvy Cravath of the Phillies batted ahead of Fred Luderus in the second inning
and both men made outs in the frame. Luderus correctly hit ahead of Cravath for
the rest of the game.

- In the seventh inning of the second game of a doubleheader 
in Cincinnati, Tommy Clarke pinch hit for Reds pitcher King Lear in the ninth 
spot in the order and hit a run-scoring single to center. Maury Uhler ran for 
Clarke and Johnny Rawlings hit for the leadoff hitter, right fielder Herbie 
Moran. Uhler stayed in the game in right field and the new pitcher, Phil 
Douglas, assumed the leadoff spot. As the ninth inning started, the ninth 
position in the batting order was due up . However, the Reds forgot the double 
switch and thought that the pitcher was next so Fritz Von Kolnitz was sent in to 
pinch hit for Douglas. A pinch hitter can not be out of order because he was 
officially batting for Uhler not Douglas. After Von Kolnitz grounded out, 
Douglas should have been the next batter in the leadoff position. However, Uhler 
came to the plate out of order and walked. Then the number two hitter, Buck 
Herzog, singled Uhler to third. He was also out of order but the Pirates never 
caught on either. The Reds scored two runs in that inning that could have been 
prevented. They were important as they tied the game at 5 runs apiece and at the 
end of the inning, the game was called due to darkness.


<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1914/B07042PTF1914.htm">7/4/1914</A>
- In the second game of a doubleheader at Pittsburgh, the 
Baltimore Terrapins of the Federal League batted out of order. In the bottom of 
the eighth inning, Fred Jacklitsch replaced catcher Harvey Russell after two 
outs were made by the Pittsburgh Rebels. He entered the game in the eighth 
batting spot. When the tenth inning started, the seventh place hitter was due up 
but Jacklitsch went to the plate and singled. However, the Rebels told the 
umpire of the error and the proper batter, Mickey Doolan, was called out. 
Jacklitsch then batted in his proper spot and grounded out to first. Pittsburgh 
won the game in the bottom of the tenth, 8-7.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1914/B08050PTF1914.htm">8/5/1914</A>
- A Federal League contest featured St. Louis at Pittsburgh. Neither team scored in the first five innings. The St. Louis sixth frame went like this: John Misse singled to right. Mike Simon singled to left and Misse advanced to second base. Bob Groom tried to sacrifice but the bunt went for a hit to load the bases. Jack Tobin forced Misse at the plate. LeRue Kirby hit a fly to center that was misjudged by Rebel Oakes, turning a sacrifice fly into an inside-the-park grand slam. However, Kirby stepped to the plate in Delos Drake's batting spot. When Pittsburgh pointed out the mistake, Drake was ruled out and the three runners were sent back to their respective bases because of the batting out of order. Kirby stepped to the plate again and this time he singled to right to score two runs. When Frank Delahanty misplayed the ball, Groom scored and Kirby advanced to third base. Hughie Miller popped out to shortstop to end the inning. St. Louis scored three runs instead of four in the frame and Pittsburgh plated two runners in the bottom of the inning for the only runs of the game. So, the batting out of order did not cost the visitors the win.

 - The St. Louis Browns were in Washington playing the Senators. The Browns batted
out of turn for most of the game without consequence. In the bottom of the eighth
inning, 3B Jimmy Austin was ejected for arguing a safe call at 3B on Howie Shanks.
SS Bobby Wallace moved to 3B and Doc Lavan entered the game at SS. Here is the
lineup as presented to HP umpire Billy Evans and how they batted for the first eight innings.
<pre>
Lineup                  As batted         Ninth Inning (proper)
Howard, 1B              Howard            Howard, 1B
Shotton, CF             Shotton           Shotton, CF
Pratt, 2B               Pratt             Pratt, 2B
E.Walker, LF            E.Walker          E.Walker, LF
Williams, RF            Williams          Williams, RF
Leary, C                Wallace           Agnew, C
Austin, 3B              Leary             Lavan, SS
Wallace, SS             Austin            Wallace, 3B
Hamilton, P             Hamilton          James, P
</pre>
 
In the top of the ninth, there was one out. Sam Agnew had replaced John Leary earlier in
the contest. Gus Williams was on 2B and Wallace on 1B. The latter had batted out of turn.
Tillie Walker strode to the plate as a pinch hitter for Lavan. However, the proper batter
after Wallace was the pitcher, Bill James, who had entered the game in the eighth inning.
Confused? Look at the third lineup column for the ninth inning list.

Billy Evans correctly ruled that Agnew was the proper batter when Wallace batted. Agnew
was called out and Wallace removed from 1B. Walker then batted in the proper order
(Lavan's spot) and made an out to end the game. 

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1915/B07251SLA1915.htm">7/25/1915</A>
 - In the first game, the Browns batting order given to the home plate umpire had Del
Pratt hitting third, Tillie Walker fourth, and Ivan Howard fifth. The first two times
through the order, Howard hit third, Pratt fourth, and Walker fifth. Babe Ruth held
them scoreless in the first two innings, but the Browns rallied for four in the third,
including hits by all three of the ones batting out of order. (Technically, Walker was
in order once Pratt's at bat was not protested.) The Red Sox did not pick up on it, so
the hits were allowed to stand. In the fourth, the Browns went back to the correct
order and told the home plate umpire what they were doing. The Red Sox did not even
realize that had happened until the fifth inning when they talked to the plate ump.
He informed them that they were way too late in their objections, The Browns won the
game 9-8. 


<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1915/B09061SLN1915.htm">9/6/1915</A>
 - The Cubs were in St. Louis for a holiday double header. In the
bottom of the second inning of the first game, with two out and Tom Long on first, Bruno
Betzel tripled. However, Frank Snyder was the proper batter but Cubs manager
Roger Bresnahan did not notice. Snyder then batted (also out of order) and
singled in Betzel. The mistake was not discovered by the Cubs until the
fifth when Snyder and Betzel batted in the proper order, which they did for
the rest of the contest. The Cardinals won the first game, 3-2, in 12
innings and then swept the Cubs, 10-0.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1915/B09250PIT1915.htm">9/25/1915</A>
 - The Pirates had catcher George Gibson batting eighth and the
pitcher ninth in their game against the Braves in Pittsburgh. In the seventh
inning, Zip Collins pinch hit for Gibson and Leo Murphy for pitcher Al
Mamaux. Murphy remained in the game catching and the new pitcher, Phil
Slattery, was placed in the eighth spot in the lineup. However, in the
bottom of the ninth, the Bucs had a runner on a two out. The next batter
should have been Slattery but Murphy came up one slot early and struck out
to end the game.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1916/B09140SLA1916.htm">9/14/1916</A>
 - The Red Sox lineup had been Duffy Lewis hitting fifth, 
Everett Scott hitting sixth and Mike McNally seventh. However, this day, McNally 
was listed ahead of Scott on the lineup card presented to umpire Bill Dineen. In 
the top of the second inning, Scott and McNally reversed places without comment 
but, in the fourth frame, Lewis singled, then after Scott made an out, McNally 
singled to send Lewis to third base. The St. Louis Browns pointed out that 
McNally was out of turn and umpire Bill Dineen called McNally out.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1917/B04120BSN1917.htm">4/12/1917</A>
 - In the top of the fourth, Lew McCarty pinch hit for the pitcher in the number nine
spot in the order and tripled to drive in two runs as part of a six-run inning. In
the bottom of the inning, he stayed in the game as the catcher replacing Bill Rariden
who was hitting in the eighth spot. This was not a real "double switch," so the new
pitcher should have batted in the number eight slot. In the sixth, McCarty hit out-of-
order in the number eight position and singled. Boston pointed this out to the home
plate umpire, and Slim Sallee, the new pitcher who should have been batting was called
out.
 
<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1917/B07090SLA1917.htm">7/9/1917</A>
 - In the top of the first inning in St. Louis, Yankees second 
baseman Paddy Bauman was hit by a pitch. The Browns appealed that Bauman had 
batted out of turn and the proper batter, Elmer Miller, was declared out.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1917/B10031PHI1917.htm">10/3/1917</A>
 - In the first game of a double header at Philadelphia, Art Fletcher of the Giants,
who was sixth in the batting order doubled in the top
of the second (or possibly in the top of the fifth according to a second newspaper) when
Dave Robertson should have hit. The hit was negated, but Fletcher managed to double
twice in the game even without the one that was nullified. Perhaps due to the improper
at bat, the box score for the game is not correct as it shows Fletcher with 6 AB, one
too many, and the lead off hitter, George Burns with one too few.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1918/B05230SLN1918.htm">5/23/1918</A>
- The Giants were in St. Louis to play the cards. In the top of the second Walter Holke,
the number six hitter walked. The number seven hitter was Jose Rodriguez, but the number
eight hitter, Lew McCarty batted next out of order. He fouled out, and it would be
expected that St. Louis would not protest, but they did. Rodriguez was called out correctly,
and McCarty batted again. This time he singled, and when Jeff Tesreau, the pitcher hitting
ninth, also singled, Holke scored. Had the Cards kept quiet, most likely Rodriguez would
have batted after McCarty and he would have been out of order since Tesreau would have
been the proper hitter. The Giants won the game 6-4 in fourteen innings, so what the
Cards did in the second may have cost them the game.


<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1919/B06280CHN1919.htm">6/28/1919</A>
 - The Cardinals played in Chicago, losing to the Cubs, 6-5.
In the contest, the Redbirds batted out of order for the first eight innings,
only correcting the mistake in the ninth. The batting order, as given to umpire
Bill Klem, showed Doc Lavan batting seventh and Frank Snyder batting eighth.
However, the two players batted in the opposite order starting in the second
inning, when the Cardinals scored two runs. Those tallies would not have counted
if the Cubs had spoken up about the miscue. Since St. Louis manager Branch Rickey
changed the batting order for this game, neither the Cardinals players nor the Cubs
realized that the two players were out of order. Lavan came to the plate in the ninth
in his proper spot (for the first time in the game) and the Cubs protested that he
was out of order when he was actually in order for the first time in the contest!

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/B06301NY11920.htm">6/30/1920</A> - 
The Dodgers were playing a doubleheader against the Giants 
at the Polo Grounds. In the bottom of the seventh inning of game 1, Lew McCarty 
pinch hit for Jesse Winters in the ninth place in the batting order and singled. 
Al Lefevre ran for McCarty and stayed in the game playing second base. The new 
pitcher, Bill Hubbell, entered the game in the seventh spot in the lineup. In 
the ninth inning, Lefevre, actually in the ninth spot, batted in the seventh 
spot out of order but struck out. Frank Snyder, the eighth-place hitter, then 
came to the plate out of order and grounded out. The next hitter should be 
Lefevre in the ninth-hole in the order. Benny Kauff was sent up to pinch hit for 
Hubbell even though it was not his turn to bat. Kauff cannot be considered as 
batting out of order since he is a pinch hitter. Officially, he is hitting for 
Lefevre not Hubbell. Kauff singled in a run but none of this matters as the 
Dodgers beat the Giants, 7-3. 

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1920/B08310PIT1920.htm">8/31/1920</A> - 
The Giants played in Pittsburgh and had one batter at the 
plate at the wrong time. Larry Doyle, batting in the seventh spot in the lineup, 
ended the seventh inning. In the bottom half of that frame the Pirates scored 
six times to pull ahead of New York, 6-5, for the eventual winning margin. The 
last two runs scored on a dropped fly ball. In the top of the eighth inning, 
fifth-place batter George Kelly started the inning with a single. The Bucs 
pointed out the fact that he was not the proper batter and Earl Smith was 
declared out.

Ty Cobb's Tigers were in Washington completing a series 
against the Senators. Before the game, Cobb changed his lineup by reversing 
Harry Heilmann and Bobby Veach. However, the skipper failed to tell the players 
of this switch. In the top of the first inning, Heilmann batted in Veach's spot 
and hit a two-run home run to left field. Umpire Billy Evans declared Heilmann 
out. When Veach finally got to bat in the fourth inning, he homered to right. 
There was also a Washington runner called out for coach's interference later in 
the game. The Tigers won, 6-3.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1921/B07041CHN1921.htm">7/4/1921</A> - 
In the first game of the holiday twin bill in Chicago, the Reds managed to bat in the
wrong order twice in the first three innings. Pat Moran, the Reds manager, thought he
had put Ivey Wingo in the number five spot, but he was eighth on the official lineup card.
In the second inning, he batted fifth and struck out for the first out, so the Cubs
naturally did not object. The next batter should have been the pitcher in the number
nine spot, but not surprisingly, Greasy Neale, the true number five hitter, hit next
and drew a walk. The Cubs protested, and after some consultation, Neale was called
out although it should have been the pitcher Dolf Luque. Pat Duncan, the number six
hitter in the order batted next although if the rule had been applied correctly, the
lead off hitter should have come to bat. Duncan fanned for the third out. The number
seven hitter correctly started the third, and he also struck out. That meant Wingo
was the proper batter, but Luque hit next and singled. The Cubs again protested.
Bill Klem, the home plate umpire called Luque out and ordered the lead off hitter
to bat. So even a Hall of Fame ump did not understand the rule, which was not
applied correctly in the second inning. This time the other ump, Bob Emslie, talked
to Klem and they got it right by calling Wingo out and having Luque bat again. He
again singled so he was able to get two hits, one of which did not count, in one
at bat. The Reds batted in the correct order after the third.

In the bottom of the first with a runner on second on two outs, William "Baby Doll"
Jacobson hitting in the clean up spot drew a walk. However, he was the number five
hitter, so the Senators objected. Based on the box score, it appears that the proper
number four batter, Marty MacManus, was called out, and Jacobson led of the second
as he should have.

This is not a real BOOT, but it is included to show some of the misunderstanding of
the rule that can arise and to illustrate some of the rule's facets. In the bottom
of the ninth of a game against the Senators, the Browns catcher Hank Servereid
batting in the #6 position singled. Homer Ezzell came in to run for him. Next up, Pat
Collins pinch hit for the third baseman and doubled in two runs to tie the game.
In the top of the tenth, Ezzell took the field at third base, and Josh Billings went
in at catcher, so Ezzell was the #6 hitter and Billings the #7 hitter. Washington
scored a run in the inning. In the bottom of the inning, the Browns tied the game
and had the bases loaded with two outs with Ezzell due to bat. Johnny Schulte came
up as a pinch hitter, and the megaphone announcer said he was hitting for Billings
rather than Ezzell. (We do not know the order shown on the umpire's official
lineup card.) After the first pitch, a ball, was thrown to Schulte, Senators
manager, Donie Bush, came to HP umpire Ducky Holmes and said Schulte should be
called out because St. Louis had not informed the umpire who was batting in which
position so Schulte should not be allowed to bat. There was no need for that to
happen since Ezzell as a pinch runner was in the #6 spot automatically. Holmes
denied the protest. Buch argued too much and was ejected. Schulte eventually was
walked by Walter Johnson, which forced in the winning run.
<p>
There are several relevant points. One is that only the HP ump has the official
lineup. Anything on the scoreboard or in this case said by an announcer may be wrong.
More importantly, a pinch hitter can never by batting out of turn. Even if the
Browns thought Billings was due up when it should have been Ezzell, it does not
matter since an improper batter never came to the plate. Another facet of the
rule is that if a team realizes that an improper batter has come up, it can
replace him without penalty before the plate appearance is completed with the
proper batter taking over the count when he comes in. So even if Bush had a
valid point, he should have waited until Schulte had walked before appealing.

A second team batted out of order on this day. The Pirates 
confused their lineup the first time though the order in this game at home 
against the Cardinals. The fifth-place hitter, Pie Traynor, had ended the first 
inning. Johnny Rawlings should have started the second inning but Charlie Grimm 
(listed seventh) batted and singled to center. Then Rawlings came to the plate 
and singled to right advancing Grimm to second base. The Cardinals then spoke 
with Umpire Bill Klem and he called Grimm out and removed him from the basepath. 
Rawlings was allowed to stay on first base. Pirates manager McKechnie told Klem 
that he intended to protest the game. The next hitter was the eighth-place 
batter, Johnny Gooch. Thus Klem seemed to call the wrong player out and allow 
the wrong batter to hit. The Redbirds had scored an unearned run in the top of 
the first inning. In the ninth, the Pirates scored two runs to win the game and 
make McKechnie's protest unnecessary.

The Cubs played in Philadelphia this day. Before the game 
the announcer listed John Kelleher playing third and batting fifth for the Cubs. 
However, when that spot in the lineup came up for the first time Bernie Friberg 
batted. He singled to left, knocking in the first run of the game but Umpire 
Bill Klem declared that Kelleher should have batted and called Friberg out for 
batting out of turn. Since Friberg was not in the lineup he should have been 
considered a pinch hitter and allowed to bat. When the Cubs took the field in 
the bottom half of the inning, Friberg went to third and played the rest of the 
game, which was won by Chicago, 7-1.

The St. Louis Browns had considerable trouble with the 
batting order in the first game of two in Washington, which they lost 5-0. 
Manager Lee Fohl changed the lineup order from the usual and the players did not 
adjust. A contemporary newspaper story said that Fohl changed the batting order 
frequently during the season. Two different swaps were made as Ken Williams and 
William Jacobson swapped the third and fourth positions and Wally Gerber and 
Hank Severeid swapped the sixth and seventh places. In the first inning, there 
was a runner on first and one out. Williams came to the plate instead of 
Jacobson and walked. When the Senators pointed out that Williams was the wrong 
batter, Jacobson was declared out and Williams batted again. This time he 
doubled to right but Eddie Foster was thrown out trying to score from first on 
the hit. Those two players batted in the proper order after that. Senators 
skipper Donie Bush noticed the other situation early in the game. In the second, 
fifth and seventh innings both Gerber and Severeid made outs so Bush said 
nothing. However, in the ninth inning, Gerber batted with two out and a runner 
on first base. He singled advancing the runner to third. Bush then spoke up and 
Umpire Ormsby declared the batter out to end the game.

In the top of the ninth inning in St. Louis, the Giants' 
Frank Snyder pinch hit for relief pitcher Jack Bentley in the ninth spot in the 
order. Snyder remained in the game as the catcher and the new pitcher, Jack 
Scott, entered the game in the eighth place in the order where the previous 
catcher had been. The seventh-place hitter, Travis Jackson, ended the tenth inning 
by grounding out. Scott should have started the eleventh inning but the Giants 
confused the order when Snyder batted in that place. Snyder singled to left and 
Hugh McQuillan ran for him. Then Scott, also out of order, singled to left. Both 
runners eventually scored and the Giants seemed to have the game in hand because 
the Cardinals did not protest the batting order. Alex Gaston entered the game as 
the new catcher in the ninth spot in the order and the Redbirds tied the game in 
the bottom of the eleventh. In the twelfth and fifteenth innings, Gaston and 
Scott batted in reverse order but both made outs in each case. The Cardinals 
never noticed the reversal since they were batting in the order that the 
defensive positions had been listed at the start of the game. St. Louis finally 
won, 13-12, in the fifteenth inning. A total of 37 players and 12 pitchers 
played in the game.

The St. Louis Browns confused their lineup in the first 
game of a doubleheader in Cleveland. Ken Williams usually hit in the third spot 
but the lineup given to the umpires had William Jacobson third, Marty McManus 
fourth and Williams fifth. In the first inning after Wally Gerber doubled and 
Jack Tobin reached on a bunt, Williams, hitting out of turn, doubled home the 
first run of the game. Then Jacobson, also hitting out of order, hit a 
run-producing ground out. McManus, hitting in his proper spot after Jacobson, 
walked. The next hitter should have been Williams but Pat Collins, the 
sixth-place hitter, came up and struck out. No more runs were scored in that 
inning. The Indians figured out that the Browns had hit out of turn later and 
tried to protest the runs scored but umpire Evans properly allowed them to 
stand. However, Cleveland came back to win the game, 4-2.

The Red Sox were in St. Louis to play the Browns. In the 
bottom of the eighth inning, Ernie Wingard pinch hit for shortstop Wally Gerber 
(in the eighth spot in the lineup) and singled. Norm McMillan then ran for 
catcher Hank Severeid (in the seventh spot in the lineup). McMillan remained in 
the game at shortstop, Tony Rego came in to catch and George Lyons to pitch. 
McMillan has to be in the seventh spot in the lineup so Rego and Lyons are eight 
and nine (or reverse). In the bottom of the ninth, after the sixth place hitter 
doubled, Rego batted at the insistance of home plate umpire Brick Owens and 
grounded out to end the inning. He was clearly out of order as McMillan should 
have batted. In the top of the tenth, Boston scored five runs. McMillan batted 
to start the bottom of the frame (out of order). After the Browns lost, Manager 
George Sisler protested the game due to the mis-application of the rules by 
Owens. The protest was upheld and the game declared a no-decision by AL

an out, and for some unknown reason, the Reds pointed out the batting out of turn.
Picinich was called out at charged with an at bat, and Bressler hit again and singled.
The Red's appeal was a mistake for more than one reason. In addition to already having
an out, most likely Picinich would have come up next, out of order. So if he had
reached, the Reds could have had the play erased and the number seven hitter called
out. Unless he homered or possibly reached third (since base advances before the
out of turn plate appearance is completed will count), the Reds still should not
have protested. The reason is that the proper batter would have been Bressler, not
the number seven hitter who almost surely would have come up next. Moreover, by
not pointing out wrong batter, the Reds could have "saved" it to use later in the
game if Brooklyn batted out of order again in a later inning.

inning, Ott strode to the plate after Farrell singled. There was an outcry from 
the fans in the stands that he was batting out of turn. It was explained by 
Terry that manager John McGraw had reversed Ott and Terry in the lineup and that 
now they were hitting in the proper order. It is interesting that the opponents 
said nothing either time but that the New York fans spoke out about the batting 
order. The Giants won, 7-1.

When is a batting-out-of turn not one? It happended in this game. 
The original lineup card submitted by Yankee manager McCarthy
listed Ben Chapman 5th and Lazzeri 6th. When Lazzeri came out to bat in the number 5
spot in the second inning, McCarthy came out to home plate and asked the umpire to switch
Lazzeri and Chapman in the lineup. Umpire Dick Nallin okayed this.

to be replayed, wiping out a 6-3 Yankee victory. Technically, the Yankees batted in
the correct order since they were following the lineup card held by the home plate umpire.
However, they were not in the order on the card given to the umpire and Tigers before the game.

The Cubs beat the Giants at Wrigley Field in a ten-inning game that witnessed an eclipse. The two teams combined for nine runs in the extra 
frame, as the hosts won the contest, 10-9. The confusion started in the eighth inning, when Stan Hack pinch ran for Charlie Grimm, who was in the 
sixth spot in the lineup. Marv Gudat pinch hit for Gabby Hartnett in the seventh spot and made an out to end the inning. He remained in the game at 
first base. At the start of the ninth, Zack Taylor entered the contest as the catcher, and would have to be in the sixth batting spot in the lineup, 
because he was the only player entering the game and that was the only empty spot. In the bottom of the ninth, Mark Koenig batted in his eighth spot and 
then Frank Demaree hit for Bob Smith. The Cubs scored one run to tie the game, 5-5. The last hitter of the inning was Johnny Moore in the fifth spot 
in the lineup. The only new player in the top of the tenth for Chicago was pitcher Guy Bush, and he was relieved before retiring anyone by Leroy Herrmann,
who should be in the ninth spot in the order. So now the order is: 
<pre>
Herman, 2b 
English, 3b 
Cuyler, rf 
Stephenson, lf 
Moore, cf 
Taylor, c 
Gudat, 1b 
Koenig, ss 
Herrmann, p 
</pre>
Although there is no doubt that the batting order above is correct, according to newspaper stories everyone thought Herrmann
was in the number six spot and Taylor was batting ninth.
After the Giants scored four runs in the top of the tenth, the Cubs half of the inning went as follows: Billy Jurges pinch hit for Taylor and made an out. Stories and boxes in the Chicago Tribune and NY Times say Jurges batted for Herrmann. Gudat fouled out. Koenig homered into right field bleachers to make the score 9-6. So far, everything is OK. Taylor then singled to right, although 
he is out of the game because Jurges hit for him. The Tribune does discuss this as a batting out of turn and says that if the Giants had protested, the proper batter, Herrmann, would have been called out ending the game. However, that is not correct. Taylor was an illegal substitution since he was out of the game. According to the rules, the plays of an illegal sub are allowed to stand. The home plate umpire should have realized that Taylor was no longer in the game and not let him bat. Herman singled to center. English hit an RBI-single to center. Cuyler hit a three-run homer into the centerfield bleachers to win the game.

The Yankees batted out of turn twice without the Red Sox 
protesting in a game that the New Yorkers won, 10-3. Manager Joe McCarthy had 
revised his lineup and the players did not bat in the order on the official 
lineup handed to the umpires. In the top of the first inning there were two outs 
when both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig walked. Ben Chapman then batted ahead of Bill 
Dickey and loaded the bases with an infield single. Dickey then came to the 
plate out of turn and singled to center scoring Ruth and Gehrig. Pitcher Rube 
Walberg then threw the ball into center field trying to pick off Chapman at 
second and both runners advanced one bag. Tony Lazzeri then singled to center 
scoring both runners. If the Red Sox had protested when either Chapman or Dickey 
hit out of turn, none of the four runs would have scored in the inning. Chapman 
and Dickey again batted out of turn the second time through the lineup but 
without any damage done. In the fifth inning, Gehrig walked and Chapman, again 
out of turn, struck out. Then Dickey batted out of turn and singled. Finally the 
Red Sox noticed and protested the batting order. The Yankees then followed the 
official lineup through the end of the game.

In the first game of two at Wrigley Field, the Reds started the 
top of the fifth with the pitcher due up. Instead, the batter at the top of 
the lineup, short stop Billy Myers, hit instead and singled. According to 
the next day's <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the "radio announcers caused quite a 
commotion in an effort to arouse [manager Charlie] Grimm, but to no avail." 
Lew Riggs then stepped to the plate and once a pitch had been made to him, 
it was too late to protest the hit by Myers. Riggs struck out, Myers stole 
second and Babe Herman singled to left with Myers moving to third. Now Grimm 
came out to protest the batting out of turn - two batters too late! The 
<i>Tribune's</i> account said: "Umpire [Cy] Rigler suggested to him that it might 
aid his pennant drive if he would try reading a rule book." Jim Bottomley 
then knocked in the run that should not have scored. However, the Cubs swept 
the double header, so only marginal damage was done by this event.

In a double header at Pittsburgh, Woody Jensen led off the

penciled into his usual leadoff position for game two. Moran called Waner out 
and Jensen, the number two hitter, was told to bat and was put out again. There 
was no reason for Wallace to speak up since Jensen was already out.

In the first game of a doubleheader with Washington visiting  St. Louis, the Browns batted out of turn in the second inning.  They had made several lineup changes this day in an effort to end their 11-game losing streak and John Berardino mistakenly batted in Joe Glenn's spot. The Senators pointed out the error and Glenn was ruled out, making Berardino the next correct batter.  Beradino then made an out.  The Browns survived this error and ended their losing streak by sweeping the doubleheader.

In a game at Comiskey Park, the White Sox had some 
difficulties with their batting order. The unofficial batting order, given to 
the official scorer a few minutes before game time, had Bob Kennedy scheduled to 
bat sixth and Bud Sketchley to bat seventh. Then came the official batting order 
as submitted to the umpires and the Indians, showing Sketchley was supposed to 
bat ahead of Kennedy. The public address announcer, who had supplied the lineup 
to scorer, corrected his listing and announced the proper order. Kennedy, 
batting out of order, supplied the third out in the second inning. In the third 
inning, before Sketchley took his turn at bat, Manager Jimmy Dykes ran out to 
Umpire Steve Basil and told him that Sketchley was not the proper batter. 
Sketchley sat and Tom Turner batted since he was listed after Kennedy. The 
Indians thought (and the scoreboard showed) that Sketchley was called out for 
batting out of turn, which was not the case since the Pale Hose successfully 
changed to Turner before Sketchley completed his turn at the plate. Turner 
doubled to left center and eventually scored. When the second out was recorded 
in the inning and the Indians saw they needed one more, Cleveland Manager Lou 
Boudreau argued and then protested the game. The protest was dropped as the 
Tribe beat Chicago, 3-2.

With one out in the bottom of the first inning, Frankie Gustine of the Pirates
singled to CF. When Braves manager Casey Stengel pointed out that Stu Martin
should have batted, Martin was called out and Gustine taken off the base.
While Martin was on the lineup card given to the home plate umpire, Gustine had
taken his place in the field when the game started. That made him an unannounced
substitution and properly in the lineup. The umpire's ruling thus was incorrect.
However, the Pirates should have pointed out that Gustine was the proper batter.

In the second game of a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds, 
the Dodgers batted out of turn in the first inning but discovered the problem 
themselves. Alex Kampouris batted one spot too early in place of Dee Moore and 
flew out. Dodger skipper Leo Durocher noticed the mistake and sent Kampouris up 
again, supposedly in his own place in the lineup. However, once Kampouris batted 
the next batter should have been Bobo Newsom who was listed after Kampouris. 
Kampy walked in his second trip to the plate. Brooklyn swept the twin bill by 
scores of 9-2 and 3-0.

In a game in Boston, the Yankees batted out of turn twice. 
In the top of the third, the New Yorkers had a run across when Joe Gordon 
doubled in the second run on the inning. Sox manager Joe Cronin came out and 
told plate umpire Bill Summers that Gordon had batted out of turn. In the 
initial frame, Gordon had struck out so Cronin wisely let the infraction pass. 
Gordon was listed seventh on the official batting order but had been listed 
sixth on the lineup given to the press. The proper batter, Rollie Hemsley, was 
called out and Nick Etten was returned to the base paths and his run negated. 
Gordon hit a solo homer in the top of the ninth to tie the game at 2 runs each. 
The contest was eventually called for darkness at 7:50pm after the eleventh 
inning. Etten's run in the third would have allowed the Yankees to win the game.

The announced lineup for the White Sox in St. Louis had Eddie
Carnett batting fifth and Guy Curtwright following Carnett. However, the
official lineup card handed to HP Umpire Joe Rue showed the two players
reversed. In the top of the first, Wally Moses singled, Roy Schalk
sacrificed Moses to second and Ralph Hodgin flied out. Hal Trosky was walked
intentionally and Carnett singled to left, scoring Moses. On the throw home,
Hodgin advanced to third and Carnett to second. Browns manager Luke Sewell
talked to umpire Rue, with the latter calling out Curtwright and nullifying
the run. The Browns won the game, 5 to 1.

The Athletics beat the Tigers, 7-2, in a wild game. In the
fourth inning, pitcher Al Benton of the Tigers was hit by a line drive by
Bobby Estalella. Benton suffered a fractured bone just above the right ankle
and was carried off the field. The Philadelphia batting order turned in to
umpire Eddie Rommel had Joe Burns batting fourth, Irv Hall fifth and George
Kell sixth. However, on the scoreboard Hall and Kell were reversed. Burns
struck out to open the bottom of the second inning. Kell, batting out of turn, also struck
out. Hall then batted and, when he singled, the Tigers protested that he was
out of order. Rommel declared Hall out, which was incorrect according to the
rules. The proper batter in this case was Dick Siebert, who followed Kell in
the lineup in the seventh spot, and he should have been declared out, not
Hall. Rommel further declared that Kell should lead off the third inning,
which is also incorrect. Since Siebert was the proper batter, Frankie Hayes
(in the eighth spot) should have led off the third inning. Since Rommel had
Kell lead off the third inning, it looks as if only five batters made six
outs in the first two frames. One result of the confusion is that Kell's
strikeout disappeared from the official records.
The confusion continued when the Tigers'
protest of the game based on Kell was not being the proper lead off batter
was denied incorrectly by the AL president.

The Browns were playing a late-season game in Detroit and were ahead, 5-0, after
eight innings. In the top of the ninth, Browns Manager Luke Sewell intentionally
skipped pitcher Nels Potter in the batting order. Don Gutteridge stepped to the
plate a turn early but made an out so nothing was said by the Tigers. Sewell
wanted Potter to have a bit more rest before the bottom of the ninth on the hot
day in Michigan and Potter finished the complete game shutout.

The Dodgers were in Boston for a doubleheader. In the 
second game, Bill Salkeld and Mike McCormick of the Braves batted out of order 
the first two times through the lineup and the Dodgers did not realize it. 
McCormick was listed in the sixth position and Salkeld the seventh on the lineup 
handed to the umpires before the game. They produced two runs before the 
visitors realized there was a problem. In the first inning, Salkeld singled Jeff 
Heath home after the latter's 2-RBI triple off the centerfield wall. Then in the 
third inning, Salkeld doubled to right and scored on Sibby Sisti's single to 
left. After Salkeld made an out in the fifth inning, McCormick singled to left 
to advance a runner. Brooklyn coach Ray Blades then spoke to the umpires about 
the batting order and McCormick was called out for batting out of turn. The 
Braves swept the twin bill with Warren Spahn pitching a 14-inning complete game 
in the opener to win 2-1 and the second game called in the middle of the seventh 
due to darkness with the Braves ahead 4-0.

The New York Giants were at Wrigley Field to play the Cubs. In the bottom of the tenth inning, the Cubs batted out of turn and,
when the Giants did not realize the mistake, the Cubs scored the winning run! The Cubs had runners on first and third with two outs
when relief pitcher Bob Rush, in the eighth spot in the order, should have come to the plate. There was a "double switch" after
Emil Verban pinch ran for Smoky Burgess in the ninth and remained in the game at second base and in the ninth place in the order.
Verban came to the plate to hit ahead of Rush and walked to load the bases. The Giants failed to speak up. Mickey Owen then
pinch hit and singled in the winning run. Once a pitch was made to Owen, the Giants lost the ability to speak up about Verban.
Due to not complaining about Verban, the #9 hitter, the correct next batter was the #1 hitter, Bob Ramazzotti, so Owen was hitting
in the lead off slot. The cellar-dwelling Cubs won, 5-4.

 - The game between the Pirates and Dodgers in Brooklyn was stopped at 11:59
because of a curfew. When the contest was resumed on 8/1, two Pirates players, Dale Coogan and Earl Turner
 had left the team. Two players (Hank Schenz and George Strickland) replaced them and the bottom of the
eighth inning continued. In the top of the ninth, Strickland should have batted but Schenz came to the plate
and grounded out. The Dodgers, who won the game 21-12, did not object since the improper batter made an out.
One amazing point in all of this is that the Pirates pitcher at the point of the suspension, Vic Lombardi, took the
mound again when the game resumed six weeks later! Moreover, the actual batting out of turn took place
over a month after the official date of the game.

 - The Cubs played in Brooklyn in a game that started at 
8:30pm. After a 30-minute rain delay in the third and another that lasted 1:20 
in the eighth, the contest finally ended at 1:21am. The official lineup 
presented to the umpires by Cubs manager Frank Frisch showed Bob Borkowski 
batting second and Carmen Mauro third. In the first inning, they batted in 
reverse order but both made outs. They repeated the process in the fourth 
inning. However, in the fifth inning of the scoreless game, the Cubs started 
the scoring. With two out and a run in, Wayne Terwilliger reached on Pee wee 
Reese's throwing error, scoring the second run for the Cubs. Mauro then singled 
to left, scoring Roy Smalley. Dodger coach Clyde Sukeforth then pointed out to 
Umpire Lou Jorda that Mauro was out of order. Borkowski, the proper batter, was 
called out, the run was nullified and the inning was over. The Cubs eventually 
won the game, 12-5.

 - In the first game of two at Wrigley Field, the score was tied at one apiece
in the top of the seventh inning. The Giants had the bases loaded with no one out
after two singles and an intentional walk to catcher Wes Westrum. Davey Williams
ran for Westrum, who was hitting in the eighth spot in the lineup. The Giants
failed to score in the frame and Williams remained in the game playing second base
and Sal Yvars entered the contest to catch and bat in the first slot in the lineup.
In the eighth inning, the Giants had a run across with two out and runners on first
and second. It was Williams turn to hit but New York manager Leo Durocher insisted
to plate umpire Lee Ballanfant that Yvars was the proper batter. Ballanfant correctly
did not comment on the idea and allowed Yvars to come to the plate. Since Yvars struck
out for the final out of the inning, the Cubs remained quiet about the batting out
of order. Chicago scored two runs in the bottom of the eighth to win the contest, 3-2.

The Cubs official lineup showed Ernie Banks playing first base and batting 
fifth. John Boccabella started the game in his place and grounded out in the 
second and fourth innings. However, in the sixth Ron Santo tripled and so did 
Boccabella, scoring Santo. The Dodgers manager Walter Alston then protested the 
batting order. Boccabella's triple was nullified and Santo placed back at third. 
Ernie Banks was deemed to be the proper batter and was called out and given a 
time at bat. However, this was an incorrect ruling by crew chief Frank Secory. 
According to rule 3.08(a)(3), Boccabella became the first baseman and the proper 
fifth place batter when he took the field in the top of the first inning as an 
unannounced substitute. Therefore, it was incorrect to remove Boccabella's 
triple and to charge Banks with a time at bat. Boccabella finished the game at 
first base, collecting a single in the eighth inning. The Cubs won with a 
two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning thanks to three walks, an error 
and Santo's sacrifice fly. The final score was 4-3.

successfully sacrificed Held to third base and the lead-off hitter, Buddy 
Bradford, followed. The White Sox continued this error in the next inning when 
the fifth spot in the lineup came up. Josephson hit with a runner on first base 
and grounded into a double play. In the seventh, Josephson hit again in his 
proper ninth spot and they continued to bat in the correct order for the 
remainder of the game, which was won by the White Sox , 12-7.

For the second time in their new life, the Seattle Pilots were involved in a 
batting out of order situation. This time, the Pilots were the ones that were 
confused. The Orioles were in town and Pilots' skipper Joe Schultz changed the 
lineup after submitting it to the umpires. The revised lineup had differences in 
the second through sixth spots, including one player substitution. Here are the 
two lineups. <BR><PRE><B>Official              Revised</B>
Harper, 2B            Harper, 2B
Hegan, RF             Simpson, CF
Davis, LF             Comer, RF
Mincher, 1B           Davis, LF
Comer, CF             Gil, 3B

Oyler, SS             Oyler, SS
Marshall, P           Marshall, P
</PRE>When Dick Simpson went to center field in the top of the first inning, he 
was considered an unannounced substitution for Don Mincher according to Rule 
3.08(a)(3) and legally in the game. Therefore, Simpson was placed into the 
fourth spot in the batting order (the umpire does not care about fielding 
positions). So now the batting order looks like this:<BR><PRE><B>After Start of Game</B>
Harper
Hegan
Davis
Simpson
Comer
Gil
McNertney
Oyler
Marshall
</PRE>
<P>The Pilots batted in the revised, incorrect order into the fifth inning. In 
the bottom of the first, Dick Simpson walked and stole second but was left 
stranded there by Wayne Comer and Tommy Davis. In the second inning, Gus Gil 
struck out and Mike Hegan grounded out. Jerry McNertney singled and scored when 
Ray Oyler homered. McNertney was out of order but Oyler was not so the homer 
could not be protested and the score was now 4-2 Orioles. In the third, after 
Tommy Harper walked, the next three batters all made outs. In the fourth inning, 
the only damage was another single by McNertney. In the fifth, the Pilots had 
runners on first and second and no one out. It was time for the second place 
hitter to bat. Simpson (out of order) struck out and then Comer flew out (in the 
correct spot after Simpson). Davis, the third-place hitter now batting in the 
sixth spot following Comer, doubled in both runners and Earl Weaver protested 
that Davis was out of order. Baltimore was ahead 9-2 at the time. Gil was the 
proper batter at the time but the umpires declared Simpson the proper batter and 
called him out for the second time in the inning and the second time in three 
batters. The official order was followed to the end of the game, which was won 
by the Orioles, 9-5. </P>

The Texas Rangers batted out of order in the bottom of the 10th inning against 
Chicago. Texas had made a double switch an inning earlier when Paul Lindblad 
entered the game as the new pitcher and Don Mincher went to first base. 
Evidently Rangers manager Ted Williams did not notify the umpire, who therefore 
recorded the substitutions in the same batting order slot as the previous 
players at the same defensive position. This is usually referred to as 'straight 
up.'&nbsp; Thus when Mincher batted in the ninth spot in the 10th inning he was 
out of order. Lindblad was called out with Toby Harrah as the runner on first 
and then Elliott Maddox struck out to end the game, with the White Sox winning 
7-6.

 - The Braves Marty Perez made the last out of the top of the sixth, but he came
up to start the seventh. Phillies catcher Tim McCarver proved to be too clever as
he pointed out the incorrect batter to the home plate umpire after the first pitch,
which was a ball. He did not realize that until the incorrect batter's plate
appearance is over, the team can replace that batter with the proper one or a
pinch hitter. The Braves sent up Jim Breazeale in place of Perez as a pinch hitter
for the pitcher, who was the correct batter. Breazeale inherited a 1-0 count, but
struck out. This was not the first time a team did not understand the rules in
order to take advantage of them. If Perez had finished his at bat and made an out,
the Phillies could have accepted the play. Most likely Breazeale would have come
up as a pinch hitter, which would have been correct since the Perez play would
have reset the lineup. The effect would have been to have Perez, a "good field,
no hit" shortstop bat an extra time, which would have delayed the top of the order
coming up by a batter. It turned out not to matter since the Braves did not score
in the last three innings and the Phillies won the game 4-3 with a run in the
bottom of the eighth.

Dwight Evans made his major league debut in the bottom of the sixth inning 
against the Cleveland Indians when he pinch ran for Reggie Smith. The Red Sox 
were leading at the time, 9-0 and Cecil Cooper had already been placed in the 
game as a pinch runner for Carl Yastrzemski. Yaz was batting third and Smith 
fourth in the original lineup. In the top of the seventh, both Cooper and Evans 
stayed in the game and three other defensive replacements were made by manager 
Eddie Kasko. With one out in the bottom of the eighth inning, Evans batted in 
Cooper's spot but flew out. No protest was made by the Indians. The next legal 
batter should have been Phil Gagliano but Cooper came to the plate and also made 
an out to end the inning and the Sox went on to win 10-0. Thus, Dwight Evans' 
first major league plate appearance was out of order!

 - Royals manager Jack McKeon made out several lineup cards before the game.
The official one he gave to the home plate umpire had George Brett hitting
second and Amos Otis batting third. The one shown on the scoreboard and the
one the Royals followed had Otis second, Hal McRae third, and Brett down in
the sixth spot. The Royals followed that order the entire game because the Red
Sox never checked the one they had been given when the lineup cards were exchanged.
In the top of the third, they could have had at least two runs erased had they
been paying attention. With runners on first and third and one out, Otis came
up in the number two spot and hit a single to left that resulted in two runs
after an error. At that point, the Red Sox could have protested and Brett would
have been called out with Otis batting again, this time with two outs. The Royals
scored three in the inning and won the game 5-2.

The Twins were playing the Indians in Cleveland and Minnesota manager Frank 
Quilici gave the wrong lineup to the Press Box and evidently to the players. Dan 
Ford, Danny Thompson and Glenn Borgmann were listed officially as batting 
seventh, eighth and ninth. However, Ford and Thompson batted in reverse order 
until the ninth inning. In the first, Thompson made the last out of the inning. 
Ford and Borgmann, who was also out of order now, both grounded out to start the 
second. In the fourth, Thompson singled but no runs scored in the inning. 
Thompson popped out to end the fifth. Ford tripled to start the sixth and 
eventually scored but Cleveland manager Frank Robinson did not object. In the 
seventh and eighth innings, all three batters made outs. In the ninth inning, 
the Twins finally batted in the proper order. Ford and Thompson both hit 
run-producing groundouts. The Twins won in the eleventh inning, 11-10, when 
Thompson drove in the game-winner with a single to center field. The Twins

In a game in San Diego, the Mets batted out of order through the whole game. The 
lineup featured Roy Staiger batting sixth, John Stearns seventh and Bud 
Harrelson eighth. This was a change from recent games when Stearns was sixth and 
Staiger seventh and the two batted this way four times in a row. In the first 
inning, Stearns hit into an inning-ending double play. Staiger made an out and 
Harrelson singled in the second (both batting out of turn). Stearns led off the 
fourth with a home run but the Padres said nothing. Both Staiger and Harrelson 
made outs, again out of order. In the fifth, Stearns and Staiger were both out 
but Harrelson started the sixth by reaching on an infield error. With two out in 
the seventh, Stearns walked and Staiger singled him to third. However, the 
Padres finally spoke up and the umpires incorrectly declared Staiger out instead 
of Harrelson, who led off the eighth inning. Even with all the batting changes, 
the Mets won the game, 9-2.

first and third but had batted out of turn. Green came out and pointed out the 
fact that the proper batter had not hit. Thus Ron Cey was called out, the 
runners restored to their previous bases and Baker batted again. This time he 
hit a three-run homer to left. Green now was very upset saying that Baker should 
not have batted believing according to newspaper accounts that Baker's force out
should count <i>and</i> Cey should be ruled out . He was ejected from the game

to the umpires. In the bottom of the first, Trevino singled with one out in the 
number two spot. Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog then pointed out that Trevino 
batted out of turn according to the official lineup. This resulted in the second 
out of the inning. According to the rules, Ramirez (the proper batter) was out. 
However, the umpires then allowed Ramirez to bat. He flied out, apparently 
ending the inning. Then Herzog talked with the umpires again about an incorrect 
batter, this time Ramirez. After a few minutes of discussion, the umpires put 
the Cardinals back on the field and made Kevin Bass, the number three hitter, 
bat. He struck out to end the inning. The Astros had lost the previous five

The Mets game in Montreal produced a comedy of errors. This was the first home 
game of the season for Montreal and their sixth overall. There were substitute 
umpires working major league games to start this season since the regular 
arbiters were locked out by the owners. When Luis Aquino and Cliff Floyd entered 
the game in the top of the sixth, the home plate umpire, Don January, 
incorrectly decided that Aquino was batting fifth and Floyd ninth. When Floyd 
came to bat in the #5 slot, Mets' manager Dallas Green told January that the 
Expos were batting out of order. Expos manager Felipe Alou claimed he had Floyd 
fifth and Aquino ninth and that January made the mistake. Alou was ejected. 
January then allowed Floyd to bat and ground out, despite knowing that he was 
not the proper batter. Then January called Aquino out for not batting in order 
and sent the runner back (that, at least, was the right call.) After calling 
Aquino out, the next batter should be the one in the sixth spot, Sean Berry. 
However, January decided that Aquino should bat now. He singled to left and then 
Berry ended the inning with a ground out. Thus, Aquino had two at bats in one 
time through the batting order. Despite this confusion the Expos won, 9-6.

stand as the play. However, according to rule 10.03(d) this is not correct. The 
complete play included the run scoring, which is why Howe objected. In this

Zaun eighth and John McDonald ninth. Overbay batted in Hill's spot in the second 
inning and made an out. Then Hill doubled but the Mariners pointed out the 
mistake. Here is where is got interesting. The umpires huddled and then called 
Hill out for batting out of order. Then Zaun was allowed to bat. The correct 
call would be that the proper batter (Zaun) should have been declared out and 
then the hitter after him (McDonald) would be the next batter. Thus, in this 
case, Hill should have been skipped entirely. The concept of skipping someone in 
the lineup is difficult for people to grasp but is the correct sequence here.

In the top of the ninth, after a double switch, the Reds
batted out of order when David Ross hit in Corey Patterson's spot. Ross flew
out to right and then Mets Manager Willie Randolph told the umpires about the
issue. Patterson was called out instead of Ross and Ross batted again and singled.
Randolph should have taken the out and kept quiet.

Brewers were playing in Houston. In the bottom of the first inning, Michael Bourn batted
first and singled to right. Brewers manager Ken Macha came out to talk with HP umpire
Eric Cooper and pointed out that Kazuo Matsui was listed first on the lineup card. Matsui
was called out and it was Bourn's turn to hit. This time, Bourn walked and scored when
Lance Berkman doubled. The Astros won despite the flub, 6-4.

 - The Rays were playing the Marlins in an Inter-League contest in South
Florida. To start the top of the ninth, the Marlins made three defensive changes. In
the bottom of the frame, Brian Barden came to the plate to start the inning and walked
on a 3-2 count. Rays manager Joe Madden talked with HP umpire Lance Barksdale about
the Marlins hitting out of order. Because Barden batted out of turn Barksdale
made him leave first base and the proper batter, Wes Helms, was called out with an
automatic putout to the catcher. Marlins manager Fredi Gonzalez came out and argued for
a long time with Barksdale, who ejected Gonzalez. There was a long discussion between
Gonzalez, Barksdale and crew chief Tom Hallion. After the game, Gonzalez insisted that
Barksdale did not correctly write down what Gonzalez said were the batting positions
for the substitutes.

In the bottom of the first inning, the Giants had a runner on 3B and one out when Buster Posey hit an RBI-double to the RF corner. Dodgers manager Don Mattingly spoke to HP umpire Tony Randazzo, saying that Posey was listed fourth and Pedro Sandoval should have been the batter. Sandoval was ruled out, the runner went back to third, and Posey came back to the plate to bat in his proper spot, making the third out of the inning and wiping a run off the board for the Giants.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2013/B09040OAK2013.htm">9/4/2013</A> - In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Rangers made a few lineup changes. Geovany Soto entered the game as the catcher and batted sixth while Engel Beltre entered the game as the new right fielder and batted fifth. Previously, the right fielder had been batting sixth and the catcher fifth. In the top of the ninth, Soto batted in his proper spot and homered. Beltre then came to the plate out of turn (he was before Soto not after) and struck out. Then Soto's spot was skipped and Jeff Baker struck out (out of turn). Jurickson Profar then struck out to end the game.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2016/B07040WAS2016.htm">7/4/2016</A> - In the top of the first during the 11AM contest in the Nation's Capital,
Brewers' left fielder Ryan Braun singled up the middle with two out. Nationals
manager Dusty Baker spoke with HP Umpire Cory Blaser, pointing out that Jonathan
Lucroy was the scheduled batter in that spot according to the lineup card.
Lucroy was called out to end the inning.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2017/B08250BOS2017.htm">8/25/2017</A> - Although it was not actually a case of batting out of turn, the Red Sox had an amazing mistake in the 9th inning of their 16-3 loss to Baltimore on August 25, 2017.  As is often the custom in such lopsided contests, the Red Sox put a position player on the mound in the top of the 9th.  In this case, it was Mitch Moreland, who had played first base the entire game to this point.  The Red Sox lost the DH for the remainder of the game and the new first baseman, Hanley Ramirez, entered the game in the 7th spot in the batting order, formerly occupied by DH Chris Young.  They made no other changes.  Moreland did well in his one inning as pitcher, allowing no runs on two hits and even collecting a strikeout.
<p>
The trouble occurred in the home 9th.  The first batter was Rafael Devers, batting in the 6th spot.  He made an out and the proper next batter was Ramirez.  However, Chris Young came to the plate and singled - even though he was no longer in the game!  Because this was an illegal reentry and not an improper batter, the umpires should have noticed it and not allowed it. No one appeared to notice - not the umpires or either team.  Since it was a 16-3 game with two outs to go, it is likely that Ramirez had not even thought about where he was batting.  As for DH Young, he simply followed Devers to the plate as he had all night.  The official remedy is to call Young a pinch-hitter for Ramirez, which causes all the official totals to come out right.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2018/B05090CIN2018.htm">5/9/2018</A> - In a game in Cincinnati, the Mets gave a lineup card to the home plate umpire that was not the same as the
one they posted in the dugout. The official one had Astrubal Cabrera hitting second and Wilmer Flores third, but the one
in the dugout had them in the reverse order. In the top of the first, Brandon Nimmo led off and struck out. Flores came up
next, out of order, and also fanned. Naturally, the Reds did not object. Cabrera then hit a ground rule double. When Jay
Bruce, the #4 hitter on both lineup cards came up, the Reds pointed out that Bruce should have hit after Flores because
an accepted out of turn play resets the position in the lineup, and Bruce followed Flores on the umpire's card. Bruce,
the correct batter was called out, and Cabrera's double was eliminated effectively meaning that Cabrera did not bat in
the first inning. Adrian Gonzalez, the #5 hitter, correctly led off in the top of the second and singled. The Reds asked
about it, and the umpire ruled properly that the single stood. For the rest of the game, Cabrera batted in the #2 slot as
he should have in the first.
