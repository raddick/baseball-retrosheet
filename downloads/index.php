<b>Retrosheet File Types</b>
<br><br>
Retrosheet's raison d'etre is to provide (primarily game-level) data for download. Retrosheet has attempted to expand the type of data available for download to satisfy the interests of all levels of baseball fans. This page provides a brief overview of the file types available from Retrosheet. More detailed descriptions of specific file types are provided at the subject heads below.

<br><br>

<i>This part hasn't been written nor have the detailed descriptions of the newer file types: player logs, game files, perhaps others.</i>

<b>Data Downloads</b>

<br><br>

Data can be downloaded three ways:<br><br>

<a href=#>By Season</a> <i>This will take you to a page that outlines what is in each season zip file with links for each season to download said zip file.</i><br><br>

<a href=#>By File Type</a> <i>This will have links to specific file types. This would basically follow the outline of the current download page.</i><br><br>

<a href=#>Download Everything</a> (1.1Gb) <i>I'm not entirely sure of the size here and, as such, I'm not sure how realistic this is, but I thought it'd be fun to have a link to a single massive zip file that includes everything that Retrosheet has available for download.</i>
