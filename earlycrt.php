<h2>Early Courtesy Runner Practices</h2>
<p>
In the early days of major league play, quite a few of the rules and
accepted practices were quite different from those in place at the
beginning of the 20th Century, which is usually considered to be
the start of the modern era. Here are some notes about courtesy
runners in the National Association, the first major league, which
existed from 1871 to 1875.
<ol>
<li>From the "Guidelines" that Bob Tiemann distributed c1990 for the 
National Association Box Scores Project, which generated the NA statistics 
gradually published in Total baseball and later elsewhere:<br>
"Pinch-runners. With the consent of the opposing team, another player was 
allowed to run the bases for a teammate. This was a common practice and 
need not be noted. If the pinch-runner stole a base or was caught 
stealing, credit the pinch-runner with the steal or caught. But if the 
pinch-runner scored, credit the original batter with the run scored."
<li>From William J. Ryczek, <i>Blackguards and Red Stockings ... 1871-1875</i> (1992), page 18,
who points out that the substitute runner was selected by the opposing captain:<br>
"Some pitchers, prima donnas even before the advent of the designated 
hitter, felt they deserved a courtesy runner on all occasions. An 1874 
Hartford-Mutual game was delayed while the opposing captains debated 
whether pitcher Mathews should be allowed relief on the base paths. The 
Mutuals at first refused to play if the courtesy runner was not allowed, 
but relented and took the field nonetheless."
<br>Ryczek cites <i>Hartford Courant</i> 4 Sep 1874 and <i>Clipper</i> 12 Sep 1874.
