<H2>Resumed Protested Games</H2>
<p>
Most protests of games are not upheld. There are many reasons for this, with the most frequent two being:<p>
1. The protest had an incorrect basis, such as a disagreement with an umpire's judgment, which cannot be protested.<p>
2. The team lodging the protest won the game, so it was never formally filed.
<p>
There have been some games when the protest has been
upheld, even when the umpires correctly enforced the rules.
Perhaps the most famous case is the George Brett pine tar bat homer on 7/24/83.
In that case, the umpires were following the existing rules to the letter
when Brett's homer was negated and he was called out.  However, AL President
Lee MacPhail ruled that the penalty was not within the "spirit of the rules"
and reversed the call.  Brett was awarded the home run and the game was
resumed from that point (with some interesting substitutions by Yankee manager Billy Martin).
<p>
When a protest is upheld, the game is supposed to be played from the
point of the protested play as corrected. However, there have also been times when the
protest has been upheld, but the
game has not been resumed. One infamous example was the Cardinals at
Dodgers game on 7/20/47 where both teams batted in the ninth, but
neither made three outs! There is a brief description after the list of resumed
protested games.
<p>
Jim Smith has provided a number of protested games that were picked up from the
point of protest at a later date, and we have received others from helpful
visitors to our web site. The list likely is not complete. Please
let us know if you can add to it. The more recent ones have links to their
boxscores and play-by-play descriptions.

<u>July 20, 1947, St. Louis at Brooklyn</u>: In the top of the ninth with the
Cards ahead 2-0, Ron Northey hits a high fly deep to the wall in right center.
The Dodgers CF Pete Reiser leaps but can't catch it, and after a couple of seconds
the ball drops back on the field where RF Dixie Walker fields it, relays it to 2B
Eddie Stanky, whose throw nails Northey at home. The first base umpire (there was
a three man crew in those days) immediately ruled the ball in play, but the other
base umpire signaled to Northey that it was a homer, so Northey slowed up. He was
ruled out at the plate, and the Cards protested the game saying Northey had been
deceived by the umpire and would have scored if he had not slowed down.
<p>
In the bottom of the ninth, the Dodgers scored three runs to win the game before
the protest by a 3-2 score. NL President Ford Frick, who later became Commissioner,
upheld the protest and awarded Northey a home run. However, he did not order the game
resumed in the top of the ninth with the Cards ahead 3-0, which would have been the
normal procedure called for by the rules. He allowed the Dodgers' runs to stand and
ruled the game a 3-3 tie. (We can only speculate on what he would have decided if
the Dodgers had hit a homer in the bottom of the ninth and scored four runs.) All
the records counted except for the pitchers' win and loss. The game was replayed
in its entirety as part of a doubleheader on August 18 that the Dodgers won.

Retrosheet's Dave Smith wrote an article about this game, which has more details,
in the Society for American Baseball Research publication <i>The Baseball Research
Journal</i>, Number 33, (2004).
