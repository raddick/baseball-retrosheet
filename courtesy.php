<H2>Courtesy Runners</H2>
<P>Until 1950, a courtesy runner was allowed for a player if that player had 
been injured and at the moment couldn't continue. The original player then 
stayed in the game defensively in the next inning, although sometimes the
injured player did not return. If the replacement runner was already in the
game, we still count this as a courtesy runner. Most often the courtesy 
runner was already in the lineup. If a courtesy runner scored, he got the
credit for the run scored. We also have four examples of courtesy fielders 
listed here. This list is due mainly to the efforts of Dave Vincent with enhancements
by Rob Wood. If you know of any other instances, please e-mail webmaster--ATsign--retrosheet.org

<P>Practices in the early years of major league play were often quite different 
from those in the early 20th Century. For more information see <A 
href="https://www.retrosheet.org/earlycrt.htm">Early Practices</A>.
 
<P><B><U>Mid-Play Runners</U></B>:<BR>We have found two cases when a player who 
was entitled to advance was physically unable to do so. A pinch runner was 
allowed to enter the game and complete the play. These are not courtesy runners 
because the replaced player was known to be unable to later come back into the game. The relevant 
rule is 5.10(c)(1) which allows for the replacement of an injured runner in a 
dead ball situation before play resumes. We list them here below the courtesy 
runners list because of the unusual circumstances for a pinch runner. If you 
know of any others, please let us know.

<BR><BR>Here are the known instances of this event from our files: <U>
<P></P>8/1/1877 (St. Louis at Louisville)</U> - In the fifth inning, Art Croft 
ran for pitcher Joe Blong. No reason is known but both players are listed in the 
lineup as playing the entire game according to the <I>The Louisville 
Courier-Journal.</I>
<P></P>
<P><U>8/28/1877 (Louisville at Boston NL)</U> - Jumbo Latham was hurt playing 
first base for Louisville. Al Nichols finished an inning for Latham but Jumbo 
batted in the next half inning and singled. Leftfielder George Hall ran for 
Latham. When Hall's turn at bat came around centerfielder Bill Crowley replaced 
Hall as the courtesy runner. After all this Latham returned to the field in the 
next half inning.</P>

<P><U>8/29/1882 (Baltimore at St. Louis AA)</U> - Jumbo McGinnis grounded to the Baltimore pitcher
Doc Landis but Ed Brown was running for him from behind the plate. On a throwing error, Brown circled
the bases with the winning run.

<p><u>6/18/1883 (New York at St. Louis AA)</u> - George Strief of the St. Louis club
injured his leg in the fourth inning. In the fourth, Strief made a hit and
limped to 1B where Tony Mullane waited. Mullane took over as a courtesy
runner once Strief reached 1B and Mullane ran to 3B. In the bottom of the
sixth inning, Strief hit the ball into an area that was closed off down the
RF line but the ball was considered in play. The enclosed area had the
players' bath in it. John Ewing ran the bases for Strief as Chief Roseman
attempted to retrieve the ball. Ewing scored on the play for a home run.
Ewing was in the game himself and merely ran for Strief on the play. 

<P><U>8/21/1884 (Detroit at Boston NL)</U> - Tom Kearns strained his knee 
running out a hit in the fifth inning. Frank Cox ran for him and was eventually 
forced out at third. Frank Meinke replaced Kearns in the field and homered later 
in the game.

<p><u>5/30/1887 (Cincinnati at Baltimore AA)</u> - In the fourth inning with one out, Jumbo Davis of Baltimore, in the eighth spot in the batting order, singled and stole second base. He tore his pants sliding into the bag at second and was replaced by Oyster Burns. Burns stole third without a wardrobe malfunction, After Matt Kilroy walked, both runners scored on a double by Bill Greenwood. Greenwood stole third and scored on catcher Jim Keenan's throwing error. After Blondie Purcell singled, Burns hit and doubled, eventually scoring a second run in the frame. Davis returned to the field with repaired pants.

<p><u>6/8/1887 Louisville at Baltimore (AA)</u> - In the third inning, Hub Collins tripled and sprained his leg. Chicken Wolf took his place on the base and scored on a hit by Pete Browning."  Wolf then hit in his own spot in the batting order, immediately after Browning, and flew out to RF. At the beginning of the fourth, there was controversy as to who would replace Collins.  Louisville's manager Kick Kelly wanted to substitute Guy Hecker, thus giving Louisville a potential fresh pitching arm, but Baltimore captain Oyster Burns protested this move and as a result, Lave Cross was placed in RF and Wolf moved to left.

<p><u>8/25/1887 (Philadelphia at Cleveland AA)</u> - Henry Larkin was too lame to run the bases so in the fifth inning, Fred Mann ran for his teammate. Cleveland pitcher Mike Morrison picked off Mann but Cub Stricker dropped the ball. Chippy McGarr then drove in Mann with a double. Mann might have run for Larkin the entire game.

<p><u>9/8/1887 (Cincinnati at Baltimore AA)</u> - In the seventh inning, Blondie Purcell of the Baltimores (batting fourth) was hit on the arm by a pitch from Elmer Smith. Oyster Burns (who batted third) ran for Purcell. Burns was forced out at second when Tommy Tucker hit to shortstop Frank Fennelly. Jackie Hayes replaced Purcell in right field when the latter could not return to the field.

<p><u>10/8/1887 (Detroit at Indianapolis NL)</u> - In the bottom of the third frame (at the time the home team often batted first), Detroit's Dan Brouthers singled and was injured stealing second. Deacon White, already in the lineup, ran for Brouthers and scored on Sam Thompson's triple. In the top of the fourth, Charlie Bennett played first base when Brouthers could not continue.

<p><u>4/28/1888 (Cleveland at Baltimore AA)</u> - In the fifth inning, Baltimore's Joe
Sommer was injured running the bases. Shortstop Jack Farrell ran for Sommer,
who returned to the field in the next half-inning.

<P><U>8/6/1888 (Indianapolis at New York NL)</U> - New York's Buck Ewing strained
his injured leg running out a 2-base error in the top of the 5th, and LF James
O'Rourke was used as a courtesy runner for him.  He was put out on a fielder's
choice on the next play.

<P><U>9/19/1888 (New York at Pittsburgh NL)</U> - In the top of the second with
home team Pittsburgh batting first, Jake Beckley hit a Texas Leaguer and
took second when no one covered the bag. He injured his ankle, and the Pittsburgh pitcher Ed Morris ran for him.
Apparently Beckley would have been permitted to stay in the game had he been able to do so, but he was
hurt too badly and had to leave the game.

<P><U>9/22/1888 (Cleveland @ St. Louis AA, game 1)</U> - In the sixth inning, Harry Lyons of the Browns was hit on the hand by Cleveland pitcher Cinders O'Brien. Charlie Comiskey, who was hitting fourth in the lineup, ran for Lyons and eventually scored a run. When Lyons could not continue, Comiskey moved to CF and Jack Boyle replaced Lyons in the sixth spot in the lineup and played first base.

<P><U>6/14/1889 (Kansas City at Brooklyn AA)</U> - Brooklyn's Oyster Burns was 
hurt while running the bases in the eighth inning. Catcher Doc Bushong was 
allowed to run for Burns and scored a run in the inning. Both Burns and Bushong 
remained in the game. 
<P><U>9/2/1889 (Pittsburgh at New York, game 2)</U> - As was a usual practice of 
the day, the home team batted first in this game. In the bottom of the third Ned 
Hanlon, hitting in the leadoff spot, singled with one out. Doggie Miller, 
already in the game in the seventh spot in the lineup, ran for Hanlon. He was 
stranded at third when the inning finished. In the next half inning, Bill 
Sowders replaced Hanlon in the field. <U>
<P>9/5/1889 (Indianapolis at New York)</U> - The visitors were batting in the 
bottom of the fifth when Tim Keefe's pitch hit Ed Andrews in the stomach. Jack 
McGeachey, who was already in the game, ran for Andrews and scored on Jack 
Glasscock's double. Andrews remained in the game.

<P><U>5/1/1891 (Cincinnati at Cleveland NL)</U> - In the bottom of the fourth,
Cleveland's Ralph Johnson was hit by a pitch and limped to the bench for treatment.
Cupid Childs, who was playing second base in the game, ran for him and eventually
scored. Johnson returned to the field in the top of the fifth.

<P><U>5/22/1891 (Boston at Cleveland NL)</U> - In the fifth inning, Cleveland's Jack
Doyle was hit on the left elbow while running the bases. When he could not continue,
Cupid Childs, who was already in the game playing second base, ran for Doyle.
Doyle was unable to continue in the field, so George Davis moved from center field
to third base and Ed Seward replaced Doyle, playing center field. Although the
replaced runner left the game, Childs was in the contest, so is considered a courtesy runner.

<P><U>5/27/1891 (Brooklyn at Cleveland NL)</U> - In the seventh inning, Adonis Terry
walked but twisted his ankle stepping  on the base. Catcher Tom Kinslow ran for him
and Terry returned to the mound in the next inning.

<P><U>6/8/1891 (Cleveland at Brooklyn NL)</U> - In the fourth inning, Jimmy McAleer
was running to third, where the fielder, George Pinkney, swung his arm and hit
McAleer on the back of the head. After a delay, Jerry Denny, already in the lineup,
ran for McAleer. In the next inning, McAleer returned to the field but seemed ill.
He was removed from the game and the Brooklyn doctor who examined him called it a
mild concussion. Ed Seward replaced McAleer in the field.

<P><U>7/3/1891 (Baltimore at Philadelphia AA)</U> - Baltimore's Perry Werden spiked 
Philadelphia's Tommy Corcoran in the first inning. Henry Larkin ran for him. 

<P><U>6/21/1894 (Boston at Washington)</U> - In the third inning, Al Maul of 
Washington, leading off, was hit on the left arm and injured. Deacon McGuire, 
Washington's catcher and cleanup hitter, ran for him. McGuire advanced to second 
on a walk, then was safe trying to steal third when Boston third baseman Billy 
Nash dropped the throw. After a fly out, McGuire scored on a triple. 
Interestingly, he was the next batter due at the time.

<p><u>8/28/1894 (Chicago at Philadelphia NL)</u> - In this game, catcher Jack Clements
was run for by two different courtesy runners. In the third inning,
Clements, in the seventh spot in the lineup, singled. Sam Thompson, batting
fifth and playing right field, ran for Clements and scored. In the bottom of
the seventh inning, Clements was hit by a pitch. Bill Hallman, hitting sixth
and playing second base, ran for Clements. Hallman advanced to third on a
wild pitch but was out on a fielder's choice later in the inning. Clements
caught the entire games for the Phillies, who won, 16 - 6.

<p><u>6/14/1897 (Chicago at Brooklyn NL)</u> - In the bottom of the sixth, Dan Daub
of Brooklyn (batting ninth), led off and was hit by a pitch.  John Grim
(batting eighth) ran for him and scored.  Daub was well enough to continue pitching,
and he singled in the seventh.

<p><u>9/10/1897 (Cleveland at Washington NL)</u> - Cleveland's Patsy Tebeau strained
his side running from first to third on Chief Zimmer's double to right in the
seventh inning. Nig Cuppy, who was not in the game, ran for Tebeau and scored
when port McAllister hit a hard bounder to Cy Swaim. Tebeau remained in the game.

<p><u>5/25/1899 (Brooklyn at St. Louis NL)</u> - In the bottom of the ninth
inning, Patsy Tebeau was hit by a pitch and injured. First baseman
Jack O'Connor was sent to first to run for his teammate. O'Connor
was already in the lineup. Since the game ended after that half
inning, Tebeau did not return to the field.

<P><U>9/23/1901 (Brooklyn at Cincinnati)</U> - Sam Crawford tripled off of Jay 
Hughes in the eighth inning, but "pulled up lame" at third. According to the 
account in the <I>Cincinnati Enquirer</I> the next day, "the Brooklyns let 
Heinie Peitz score a run for him and then permitted the Nebraskan [Crawford, for 
anyone who doesn't know the whereabouts of Wahoo] to return and finish the 
game."

<p><u>9/27/1901 (Cleveland at Philadelphia)</u> -  Ollie Pickering batted first for
Cleveland with Zaza Harvey second.  After Pickering was retired in the top
of the fifth, Harvey was beaned by a pitch. Pickering ran for Harvey and
scored later in the inning. Harvey was hurt badly enough to be taken out of
the game, as Bob Wood replaced him in LF in the next inning.

<p><u>5/12/1902 (Chicago at Detroit)</u> - In the bottom of the sixth inning,
Doc Casey ran from 1B to 3B on Dick Harley's single to RF. Pop Dillon replaced
Casey at 3B and was stranded there. Casey returned to the field in the next inning.

<U><P>6/26/1902 (Giants at Philadelphia)</U> - In the bottom of the eighth, catcher 
Fred Jacklitsch was hit "behind the ear" by a pitch from Roy Evans, and "dropped 
like a shot." Hallman, who was in the game as the third baseman ran for him and 
Jacklitsch returned to his duties in the ninth.

<p><u>9/11/1903 (Philadelphia(AL) at New York(AL)</u> -  In the bottom of the first,
John Ganzel was hit in the head by a pitch from Eddie Plank, and Clark Griffith
ran for him.  Ganzel returned to the game in the top of the second.

<P><U>9/17/1903 (Cleveland at Boston)</U> - Cy Young ran twice in this game for
Charley "Duke" Farrell who was playing his first game coming back from an injury.
In the bottom of the fifth, Farrell singled and Cy ran for him, moving to third
on a single to center and scoring on a triple. In the sixth, Farrell doubled,
and Young once again was permitted by Cleveland to run for him, but did not
advance. Boston won the game 14-3. Young was a capable runner as can be seen
from his two stolen bases two days earlier while hurling a 12-3 victory over
New York.

<P><U>5/30/1904 (Giants at Philadelphia, game 1)</U> - In the top of the sixth of 
the first game, Moose McCormick was injured running out a double so John McGraw 
ran for him but McCormick returned to CF in the bottom of the inning.

<p><u>8/18/1904 (St. Louis at Philadelphia NL, game 1)</u> - In the top of the third of game
1, Dave Brain reached on an error but was injured on the play. Jake Beckley,
who had made an out earlier in the inning, ran for Brain. Mike Grady singled
and Beckley was thrown trying to score on the play. Brain returned to the
field in the bottom half of the frame.

<P><u>8/8/1905 (Dodgers at Cardinals, game 1)</U> - In the bottom of the first 
inning of game one, Homer Smoot was struck on the head by a pitch. Jake Thielman 
ran for Smoot and scored a run. Smoot resumed his position in centerfield in the 
next half inning.

<U><P>9/7/1905 (Boston at New York NL, game 1)</U> - In the first game of a double 
header, Rip Cannell stole second base in the top of the second inning. Cannell 
cut his leg sliding into the bag. Fred Raymer, who followed him in the batting 
order, flied out, and then went to second to run for Cannell. Raymer was 
stranded there and Cannell resumed his defensive position in the bottom of the 
inning. 

<P><U>9/30/1905 (Superbas at Pirates, game 2)</U> - In the second game of two, Honus 
Wagner was hit by a pitch in the fourth inning. Brooklyn allowed Mike Lynch to 
run for him. The Pirates had won the first game, 8-3, and the second game ended 
in a tie, 2-2.

<p><u>9/30/1905 (Philadelphia at Cincinnati)</u> - In the bottom of the seventh
inning, Johnny Siegle was hit on the wrist by a pitch. Fred Odwell, who was
already in the game, ran for Siegle. Siegle returned to the field in the
next inning.

<P> <U>10/5/1905 (Philadelphia at New York NL, game 1)</U> - In the top of the 
second inning of the first game of a doubleheader, pitcher John Lush was hit in 
the head by a Christy Mathewson pitch, knocking him out and forcing in a run. 
Kitty Bransfield, who had made out earlier in the inning, ran for Lush but the 
hurler returned to the game in the bottom half of the frame. The Phillies won 
the game, 4-1, but lost the second, 5-3.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1906/B04220CHA1906.htm">4/22/1906 (Cleveland @ White Sox)</a> - In the bottom of the third inning, Frank Hemphill was hit on the head
by a pitch from Harry Eells. Since Hemphill was a little wobbly, Cleveland manager Nap Lajoie agreed to allow 
Rube Vinson to run for him while he recovered. Hemphill returned to the game in the next inning.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1906/B08190CHN1906.htm">8/19/1906 (New York @ Chicago NL)</a> - In the top of the ninth inning, Giants second baseman Billy Gilbert fell rounding 3B on Spike Shannon's single. After Gilbert scrambled back to the base, he was unable to continue. Cubs manager Frank Chance allowed Art Devlin, who was playing 3B for New York, to run for Gilbert.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1906/B09120PHA1906.htm">9/12/1906 (Senators at Athletics)</a> - In the fourth inning, Philadelphia's 
pitcher Mike Cunningham was injured in a collision at first base. His left 
(non-pitching) shoulder, which he had previously injured in a football game, was 
dislocated on his RBI single to first baseman Jake Stahl as he tripped over Stahl's leg.
Pitcher Hack Schumann ran the bases for Cunningham, making his major league debut.
Cunningham returned to the mound and pitched a complete game.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1907/B04300CIN1907.htm">4/30/1907 (Chicago at Cincinnati)</a> - In the bottom of the first inning, Hans Lobert was struck on the side of the face by a pitch. Admiral Schlei, not in the game, was allowed to run for Lobert and scored on John Ganzel's triple. Lobert returned to SS in the top of the second. Schlei replaced Ganzel at 1B in the seventh inning.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1907/B07311PIT1907.htm">7/31/1907 (Doves at Pirates, game 1)</A>
- In the top of the ninth, a pitch by Vic Willis hit Johnny Bates in the side of the head, knocking him out cold for five minutes. Frank Burke had pinch it for Cy Young in the third and was coaching at first ran for Bates. The Boston did not
score in the top of the ninth. Pirates won 7-4, so there was no last half of the ninth or need for a new right fielder.
Burke played in right in the second game.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1907/B08030WS11907.htm">8/3/1907 (Tigers at Senators)</A>
- George Mulln's pitch hit Rabbit Nill in the head in the bottom of the second. Washington did not have another infielder, so
losing Nill would cause a major problem. Case Patten ran for Nill, and the Tigers let Nill go back into the field
in the next inning.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1907/B09131DET1907.htm">9/13/1907 (Indians at Tigers, game 1)</A>
- Ty Cobb doubled in the bottom
of the fourth, but hurt himself sliding into second. Hughie Jennings was allowed
to run for Cobb, but was thrown out at the plate trying to score on Claude Rossman's
single. Cobb resumed in the field in the top of the fifth of the game, which the
Indians won 4-1.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1908/B06010CHN1908.htm">6/1/1908 (Pirates at Cubs)</a> - In the bottom of the third inning, Jimmy Sheckard walked and Frank Schulte doubled down the LF line. When Sheckard hurt his ankle sliding into 3B, Doc Marshall was allowed to run for Sheckard. Marshall scored on Solly Hofman's fly ball. Sheckard returned to the field in the fourth inning.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1908/B09300CIN1908.htm">9/30/1908 (Chicago at Cincinnati)</a> - There were two courtesy runners employed by the Cubs in this game. In the top of the first inning, Johnny Evers was beaned by Jean Dubuc. Del Howard, who was not in the lineup, ran for Evers and was stranded on the bases. Evers remained in the game after that short break. In the top of the fourth, Harry Steinfeldt singled. At that point, Pat Moran was substituted for Steinfeldt, who returned to his position in the next frame. Moran scored a run before leaving the contest.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1909/B10040CHN1909.htm">10/4/1909 (Pittsburgh at Chicago NL)</a> - Jimmy Archer ran for Mordecai Brown twice in this game. In the fifth, Brown singled to CF and Archer was promptly forced at 2B. The eighth inning was a little more exciting. Brown led off the inning with an infield single and Archer ran. Johnny Evers was hit by a pitch, Jimmy Sheckard sacrificed, Frank Schulte tripled two runs across (so Archer scored), Fred Luderus singled in another tally and Heinie Zimmerman reached on a dropped popup. Solly Hofman singled in another run, Joe Tinker singled in the fifth run of the frame and Pat Moran was hit by a pitch. Mordecai Brown hit for Archer (or was it for himself?) and forced Hofman at HP. Evers reached on a fielder's choice and all runners were safe on an error at 2B. Sheckard singled two more runs and the inning ended with a pop out by Schulte. The Cubs scored all their runs in this inning to beat the Pirates, 8-2. There was no reason listed for the courtesy runners and Brown was not injured.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1910/B08292CHN1910.htm">8/29/1910 (Philadelphia at Chicago NL)</a>
- In the first inning of game two,
Phillies pitcher Ad Brennan hit Jimmy Sheckard on the back of the head.
After a delay, Sheckard wanted to remain in the game but was taken to the
bench. Starting shortstop Heinie Zimmerman ran for Sheckard. John Kane
replaced Sheckard in left field when the latter was unable to remain in the

courtesy runner since the pinch runner was already in the contest.

struck out, the Lewises (no relation) pulled off a double steal. Jack Lewis was 
shaken up in a collision with New York shortstop Roy Hartzell at 2b and Duffy 
Lewis was given permission to run for him. Apparently, one Lewis is as good as

catcher and eighth batter Bill Carrigan was hit over the left ear by a "fast 
inshoot" from Joe Benz. "The ball sounded as though it had hit a bass drum" 
(Boston Post). He took his base and was determined to stay in the game so they 
tried to get him into condition. White Sox Manager Callahan permitted fourth

out, ending the inning, and Carrigan was still too dazed to play, so Forrest

the 4th inning. Pitcher Hank Borowy went in to run and eventually scored as 
Nicholson went for a new shoe. Nicholson returned to RF in the top of the 5th. 

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1949/B05152SLA1949.htm">5/15/1949 (Detroit at St. Louis AL)</A> - In the opening frame of the nightcap, 
Bob Dillinger singled and stole second. He bruised and twisted his knee and Sherm Lollar ran for Dillinger. Dillinger played third for two innings 
before retiring for the day.


<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1949/B06140BOS1949.htm">6/14/1949 (Indians at Red Sox)</A> - In the top of the first inning, Joe 
Gordon hit a grand slam off Joe Dobson to make the score 5-0 with no outs. As 
usual for that time, Dobson hit the next batter, first baseman Lou Boudreau. 
Boudreau was replaced as a runner by Ken Keltner who was already in the lineup 
as the third baseman. (Keltner had just scored on the slam.) Dobson walked the 
next batter and left the game without retiring anyone. Keltner scored another 
run on a single to right by Bob Feller. In the bottom of the first, both Keltner 
and Boudreau take the field at their assigned spots.</P>

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1949/B07020CLE1949.htm">7/2/1949 (Browns at Indians)</A> - In the bottom of the ninth inning, Ray 
Boone was hit on the arm by a pitch from Karl Drews. Jim Hegan, already in the 
lineup catching, ran for Boone and scored. Since this inning was the end of the 
game, the players do not return to their defensive positions.</P>

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1952/B08102PIT1952.htm">8/10/1952 (Cubs at Pirates, game 2)</A> - (COURTESY FIELDER) In the top of the
ninth of the second game of a twin bill, Pirates catcher Clyde McCullough was
injured and could not continue. The Pirates two other catchers, Eddie Fitzgerald
and Joe Garagiola, had already been used in the game as pinch hitters. With the
approval of Cubs manager Phil Cavarretta, Fitzgerald was allowed to replace
McCullough. The Cubs won the game 4-3. Under the playing rules in effect since
the 1950 season, that was an illegal substitution that the umpires should not
have allowed.</P>

<P><u>6/12/1888 (Blues at Bridegrooms AA)</u> - In the fifth inning, Brooklyn's Dave Foutz hit a home run but sprained his ankle running the bases. He stopped at 3B and was relieved by Ed Silch. Silch scored the run and remained in the game in RF. The box score in the NY Sun credits Foutz with the run scored.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1977/B09070CAL1977.htm">9/7/1977 (Brewers at Angels)</A> 
 - In the bottom of the 6th, Bobby Bonds was on 2nd base with 
one out and attempted a steal of third. Catcher Charlie Moore's throw hit Bonds 
in the head, sending him to the hospital. The ball ricocheted out of play, but 
Bonds couldn't make the trip home. Instead, substitute runner Gary Nolan (a 
pitcher) scored the run. 
<P><A 
href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2005/B09140TOR2005.htm">9/14/2005 (Red Sox at Blue Jays)</A> - In the top of the 5th, Gabe Kapler was on first when 
Tony Graffanino hit a deep fly ball near the line in left that Kapler thought 
might be in play, so he started running hard. As he rounded second base, he 
ruptured his left Achilles tendon and sprawled on to ground. The ball went over 
the fence for a homer, but Graffanino wisely stopped at second base while Kapler 
was attended to. After many minutes, Kapler was loaded onto a cart and taken off 
the field. Alejandro Machado, appearing in his 4th Major League game, entered as 
a pinch-runner and scored his first Major League run in front of Graffanino.
