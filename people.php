Retrosheet has created pages for all of the participants in games for which we have collected data. You can download full biographical data on all players, coaches, managers, and umpires for whom Retrosheet has collected game accounts at the link below.<br><br>

<i>The above links don't exist yet. One possibility is to make those search boxes rather than links. I have some experience with that at <a href=https://baseball.tomthress.com/>my website</a>. That would require setting up a database to search over - which is probably the way to go here. At least initially, all we'd really need would be to convert Retrosheet's biofile into a database for searching.
<br><br>
My thinking in terms of pages is to model them after what I've done for the Negro League players (note: in part, this is because, having already constructed the pages for Negro League players, I feel more comfortable generating pages that look like this), with the game logs being front and center as opposed to the season stats (which I do think more accurately conveys the value being added here by Retrosheet) - something like this:</i> <a href=https://www.retrosheet.org/players/bellj103.htm>Cool Papa Bell</a>.
