<h2>Forfeits</h2>
<p>In the 19th Century, forfeited games were fairly frequent, and they were quite a
few in the first two decades of the 20th Century. Even in the 1970s there were four of
them, and the most recent one was in 1995. Three of the last four resulted from promotions
that backfired.

<p>This list contains a description of forfeited games along with their newspaper reference. The words enclosed
in parentheses at the end are the keywords used to find the newspaper articles through ProQuest. Gary Frownfelter

Terence Connell had officiated in Washington there was trouble. This game was no exception. In the 4th, Washington had two men on with a count of 2 strikes

batter hit a ground ball to third and was thrown out at first. However, Connell called him safe and the runs scored. Washington's president pulled the team from the field in the 6th. Cincinnati was leading at the time 6 to 0. The umpire had to be esc
orted
from
the field by two policemen. New York Times, 06/01/1884, p 2 and Washington Post, 06/01/1884, p 2 (Cincinnati)

dropped the ball. He picked it up and stepped on the plate to force the runner 
from third base. Hines then chased Hanlon down the first base line before 
throwing him out to complete the double play and the inning. Current rules would 
prevent this play as the batter is automatically out when first base is occupied 
on a dropped third strike with less than two out. Detroit captain Frank Cox 
objected to the call by umpire John Gaffney saying that Hines had intentionally 
dropped the ball to make the double play. The rest of the Detroit squad took the 
field but Cox refused to continue the game. Gaffney gave Cox five minutes to 
change his mind and when, at the end of that time Cox still refused to play, 
Gaffney forfeited the game to Boston. There is detailed coverage of this game in

escort the umpire from the field after the game. A half-hour before the 
scheduled start of this game Johnstone arrived at the Polo Grounds to assume his duties, but was denied entry by the club. He then immediately called the game a forfeit 
in favor of the Cubs. The other umpire assigned to the game, Bob Emslie, had already entered the grounds, but by league rule, quickly left when he heard of Johnstone's situation. At 4 PM, the scheduled game time, the New York team took the field and 
not seeing an official umpire in
the

<p><u>10/04/1909 - Philadelphia at New York</u> - NL - In the 4th inning of the second game of a doubleheader and the last game of the season, 
Phillies pitcher Lew Moren complained about a pitch being called a ball. By the time the argument
 was over, umpire John Mullin had ejected Moren, Otto Knabe and Red Dooin. The 
latter two players refused to leave and the game was forfeited to New York. At 
the time of the forfeit, the score was tied at one run each. - Washington Post, 10/05/1909, p 8 (forfeit) 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1913/B07062CHN1913.htm">07/06/1913 - St. Louis at Chicago</A> - NL - The second game of a doubleheader was forfeited to St. Louis by umpire 
Mal Eason. Both managers had agreed before the start of the game that it would end at 5 PM to allow the visiting team to catch a train to the east. Chicago manager Johnny Evers started Orval Overall, who had not started a game in over a month 
while nursing a bad back. Overall allowed three runs in the first inning. When Chicago came to bat in the second, they started to stall. Overall came to the plate and took a strike. Evers then summoned a player in the clubhouse as a pinch hitter, who
 took his time coming to the plate. When the pitcher started his wind up, the batter stepped away to wipe his eyes. The umpire called a strike.
 The next inning the new
pitcher, Ed Ruelbach, took his time warming up. In the fourth St. Louis' Ivey Wingo 
laid down a bunt. The pitcher threw the ball wild to first base and Wingo headed for second. The ball came in to second 
but no effort was made to put the runner out. Wingo headed for third and no play 
was made on him again. The umpire had enough and called the game. - New York Time; 07/07/1913, p 6 (St. Louis)
 
<p><u>06/26/1914 - Washington at Philadelphia</u> - AL - The first game of the doubleheader was given to the home team by umpire 
Ollie Chill in the 4th inning. Chill had called numerous pitches made by Washington pitcher Joe Engle balls because the pitcher had both feet off the rubber when the pitch was delivered. Clark Griffith, the Washington manager, protested and refused to continue play. Philadelphia won the second game in 10 innings. - New York Times; 06/27/1914, p 8 (Athletics)

- NL - The score was tied 4 to 4 when Brooklyn came to bat in the tenth. Hi Myers 
reached second base on a wild throw and went to third on a bunt by Jimmy Johnston. Johnston then stole second. With the count 
2 and 2, Hippo Vaughn, the Chicago pitcher, took too much time to deliver the next pitch and umpire 
Lord Byron called a ball. Cubs manager Joe Tinker protested, claiming that Brooklyn was stealing their signs and 
Hippo Vaughn was trying to communicate that
 to the catcher. Byron asked Tinker to leave the field, but he refused and kept arguing. Byron then asked a policeman to escort Tinker off the field. Tinker still refused to go, so Byron called the game 
in favor of Brooklyn. - New York Time; 07/19/1916 p 10, Washington Post; 07/19/1916 p 6 (Cubs)

ally threw the ball to center field. Owens called the game

 - AL - The second game of a doubleheader was awarded to the Cleveland Indians. With Cleveland leading in the ninth inning, 9 to 1, a barrage of seat cushions poured out of the stands onto the field. Th
e fans in the lower levels ran out onto the field to escape the cushions raining down on them. No police were there to help. A few employees tried to clear the field, but could not. Umpire 
Dick Nallin called the game for the visitors. - The Athletics of Philadelphia, p 78

 - AL - The second game of a doubleheader was forfeited to the visiting team with 
two outs in the last of the 9th inning. The bleacher fans poured out onto the field 
when they thought a foul ground ball was the last out of the game. Umpire Ollie Chill

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1924/B06130DET1924.htm">06/13/1924 - New York at Detroit</A>
 - AL - Babe Ruth led off the 9th inning of a game at Navin Field with the Yankees 
leading 10-6. A young left-handed Tiger pitcher, Bert Cole, was on the mound. Ruth 
had to duck out of the way twice from pitches near his head before fouling out 
to the first baseman Lu Blue. The next batter, Bob Meusel, was plunked in the ribs 
with the first pitch. He dropped his bat, walked to the mound and took a swing at 
the pitcher, but missed. Umpires Billy Evans and Red Ormsby grabbed Meusel and 
pulled him away. About that time Ruth charged from the dugout swinging his fists 
and claiming that the pitcher was throwing at the Yankees. Players poured onto the 
field and shoving and pushing ensued. After a few minutes, peace seemed to be 
restored and players started to return to their positions. However, Meusel and 
Ruth took a detour on the way back to their dugout and headed to the Tiger bench 
and started fighting again. The fans could no longer control themselves and streamed 
onto the field. Police quickly surrounded the dugout and escorted the players to 
safety. Fist fights between fans and policemen and among the fans broke out all over 
the field. It took over a half hour to clear the field but by that time the umpires 
had already called the game for New York. - New York Times, 06/14/1924, pg 8,

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1925/B04260CHA1925.htm">04/26/1925 - Cleveland at Chicago</A>
 - AL - Because of the large crowd at Comiskey Park, fans were allowed to stand 
behind roped off areas in right and left fields. Cleveland was leading 7 to 2 in 
the bottom of the 9th inning with two out when Willie Kamm hit a soft grounder to 
the shortstop who threw a perfect ball to first. First baseman Ray Knode caught 
the ball two feet in front of the bag and tried to find the bag with his foot. 
However, after several attempts, he could not find it and the batter was called 
safe by umpire Billy Evans. The fans, thinking the play resulted in the final out 
of the game, rushed the field. The field could not be cleared and the chief umpire, 
Pants Rowland, had no choice but to call the game in favor of Cleveland. - 
Chicago Daily Tribune, 04/27/1925, p17 (Indians) 

<p><u>06/06/1937 - St. Louis at Philadelphia</u> - NL - The first game of this 
doubleheader had been delayed 88 minutes by rain thus delaying the start of the 
second game. The games had to be completed by 7 PM due to a Philadelphia law. 
The Cardinals were leading 8-2 in the top of the fourth inning of game two when 
the Phillies started stalling. They made unnecessary pitching changes, holding 
mound conferences and asking for different baseballs. Eventually Bill Klem 
forfeited the game to the Redbirds. All players statistics were wiped out due to 
the fact that the game failed to go the required five innings. Manager Jimmie 
Wilson was fined $100 later by Ford Frick for his stalling tactics. Joe Medwick 
of St. Louis lost a home run which would have been his tenth of the season. 
Medwick still won the Triple Crown even though he tied for the home run title 
with Mel Ott with 31. - New York Time; 06/07/1937; p 27 (Philllies)

George Pipgras. The Senators were leading at the time 6-3. Boston manager Joe 
Cronin protested the game claiming that the field was not playable because it 
was not covered by canvas. On 08/27, AL president Will Harridge upheld the Boston protest and awarded them the victory. He said that Washington violated rules by not having a grounds crew available to cover the field. The Cleveland club then proteste
d the Harridge decision claiming the decision was unfair to them in their 
pennant race with Boston. Washington Post, 08/16/1941, p 12 (Red Sox) New York Times, 08/28/1941, p 25 (forfeit) New York Times, 08/28/1941, p 20

had swarmed onto the field where several punches and wrestling matches broke out. 
Redbirds catcher Sal Yvars and Philles batter Earl Torgeson started the brawl 
and were both ejected. Managers Terry Moore and Eddie Stanky also tangled. Moore 
had previously been fired as a Cardinal coach by Stanky. Moore came out of his 
dugout after Yvars but Stanky tackled Moore. With darkness approaching and the game not yet official, Eddie Stanky brought in three new pitchers
