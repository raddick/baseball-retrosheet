<p>Details of these games were provided by Paul Rivard<br>

<br>
From <i>The New York Times</i> (09/03/1918 issue):<br>
<br>
<b>Claim Games by Forfeit<br>
St. Louis Ready to Play, but Cleveland Missing</b><br>
<br>
St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 2 - Although Business Manager Bob Quinn
of the St. Louis Americans had been officially notified Saturday
that the Cleveland team would not be here for today's scheduled
double-header, Manager Jimmy Burke put his men on the field at
1:45 and claimed both games by forfeit. 
The scores will be sent to President Ban Johnson of the American
League. Grover Lowdermilk was umpire. Two pitchers pitched five
balls each, in compliance with the rules. There were ten minutes
between "games".<br>

The following is a portion of an article about the first game of
the World Series being postponed. It was published in <i>The
Washington Post</i> on 09/05/1918:<br>
<br>
The commission will hold a formal meeting tomorrow to talk
over some minor world's series details and take up the case of
the two games the Browns claimed by forfeit as a result of
Cleveland's failure to play in St. Louis on Labor Day. The
games, even if forfeited to the Browns, will make no difference
in the standing of the clubs. The commission, however, may fine
the Cleveland club for its failure to play.<br>

<br><br>
Further newspaper searches failed to turn up any mention of that
National Commission meeting. However, no source lists these games as forfeits.
