<a name="New Data Release"></a>
<i>When will additional seasons be posted on the web site?</i>
<p>
12-7-2002
<p>
Retrosheet policy is firm that game information is posted on the web
site only after a detailed process of proofing and comparison to official
totals.  This policy covers the narrative game accounts and box scores as
well as the data files that are our primary form of storage.  Depending
on the number of corrections that need to be made and on the nature of our
raw information, this proofing can take many months for a single season.
It is, therefore, not possible to make promises or predictions concerning
future releases.  Proofing work is always underway and help is always needed
in this area.  See the FAQ on volunteering for more details.
<p>
In addition to the regular season data which comprise the bulk of our
information, Retrosheet also has the data for all post-season games,
beginning with the 1903 World Series.  These games are also being proofed
and are a high priority for release, although once again a specific
timetable is not possible.

<a name="Post-1992 Data"></a>
<i>Why are there no games newer than 1992 on the Retrosheet web site?</i>
<p>
7-30-2004
<p>
Detailed information for games played after 1992 is not available to
Retrosheet.  There are commercial organizations which do possess the
newer data, but they have not made it available for public distribution.
Game accounts were collected by Retrosheet with the clear understanding
that we intended to publish them once they had been proofed in accord
with our release policy.  Retrosheet has, therefore, concentrated on
older games that have never been systematically collected before.

<a name="Volunteer"></a>
<i>How can I volunteer to help?</i>
<p>
12-14-2002
<p>
Retrosheet has always depended on the generous donation of time by volunteers.
This is still true, but circumstances have changed since we began work in 1989.
As a result, the nature of the help we need has changed as well.  A brief
historical summary is a good place to begin.  However, this is a multi-faceted
topic and there are many topics to be addressed.
<p>
First, where did we get the raw data?  We began by collecting scorebooks from
the Major League teams..  Teams vary widely in the extent of their historical
records.  Some of the “original 16” (clearly an incorrect term, but one that
is commonly used to describe the era in which there were no franchise changes
from 1903-1952) have scorebooks going back to 1946, whereas some have nothing
older than 1974.  The majority have coverage back into the 1960s.   After many
years, we were able to persuade all 26 teams which existed in 1983 to allow us
to copy what they had.  While this was going on, we also made contacts with
dozens of sportswriters and announcers (and the families of those who were
deceased) and obtained a very large number of additional accounts that the
teams did not have.  The third major source is individual fans who scored the
games, usually at the park on a standard scorecard.  This has also been a very
important way for us to get information, and it is ongoing as Retrosheet
volunteers prowl eBay and other on-line auction services for these items.
The final data source for us has been play by play descriptions from
newspapers.  Many fans are not aware that for much of the 20th century
(and also the 19th century), it was common for newspapers to carry the full
play by play text of the game played in that city that day (see the
<a href=clepbp.jpg>example here</a> from the Cleveland Plain Dealer for the 
game of April 30, 1930).  This practice was especially important in the
days before widespread radio coverage.  Since only day games were played
until the late 1930s, the usual pattern was that an evening paper, published
at 6 PM or so, would have the game information.  All told, Retrosheet has
over 105,000 accounts of games played prior to 1984, representing about
70,000 games (there are many games for which we have multiple, independent
accounts).
<p>
As these accounts were being collected, we began the process of translating
them into our format so the information could be stored in the computer.
Without a rational computer system for describing and recording the events
of the games, it would be impossible to do analysis or even meaningful
archiving of the games.  Using the DiamondWare system, dozens of volunteers
spent literally thousands of hours poring over scoresheets, deciphering
occasionally mysterious notations, and entering them into our standard
computer format.  Anyone who keeps a scoresheet develops individual, special
features and some of the ones we have were extremely challenging to translate,
but our stalwart crew got the job done.  At this point, we have very few
scoresheets and programs left to process, almost all of them from earlier
than 1953, and many of them are among our more difficult sources. It is not
feasible to break in potential new volunteers on this kind of material.
Therefore, Retrosheet is no longer looking for additional volunteers to enter
games from scoresheets, although there are other ways in which volunteers can
contribute.
<p>
We do still have a few thousand of the pre-World War II newspaper accounts on
hand that need attention, However, many of these present a separate problem,
namely that we do not have box scores to go with them.  Without a box score,
it is almost impossible to enter one of these newspaper accounts, since
fielders are referred to by name, not position.  To illustrate with a simple
example, "a fly ball to Ruth" might be "7" or "9", depending on which park the
Yankees were playing in.  (Ruth played over 1000 games each in left and right
fields.  Although this particular fact has been known by SABR researchers for
some time, there are many other interesting little tidbits that we uncover).
This problem can be solved by having the box score from The Sporting News or
the New York Times.  We can use help in making copies from either source (from
microfilm), either as part of inputting activity or as a separate effort.
Contact Dave Smith (dwsmith@udel.edu) if you have the time to spend on it.
He will steer you to the seasons we need help with.  Your costs for 
photocopying and postage will be reimbursed, but of course we have to rely
on the generous donation of a much more valuable commodity, namely your
time.  Finally, note that there are still many thousands of newspaper
accounts out there waiting to be copied, but this will usually entail the
borrowing of microfilmed newspapers via Interlibrary Loan, which is not
realistic for most people.  However, we would welcome with open arms offers
to do this kind of data collection.  Once again, contact Dave for more details.
<p>
There is another kind of data collection that does not involve play by play
data, but  rather a careful study of box scores.  There are really two
categories here.  The first is what might be called ancillary information
such as game length, attendance, umpires, starting time (or at least day/night
indication).  It is surprising how many of the scoresheets from the teams,
writers and announcers did not record these items.  Although our accounts are
still useful without them, it is disappointing not to have such basic facts.
The second category involves our game logs which contain over 100 data items
for every game (see https://www.retrosheet.org/gamelogs/index.html).  There
are varying degrees of completeness in the logs for different years.  For the
years from 1974 to the present, the logs are complete.  However, for earlier
seasons only the bare minimum of information is present, although we do have
scores, managers and starting pitchers.  As we get more seasons proofed and
ready for release, we will be able to fill in the details for these years.
However, for many seasons our holdings are pretty incomplete and it will not
be likely that we can complete the logs from our own play by play files.
Once again the good news is that all or most of the items we need are readily
available from the daily newspaper box scores.  If you are interested in
spending some time at the microfilm machine tracking down and recording the
data, that would be very helpful.  Contact Dave for more details.
<p>
Our other major activity is the proofing of games that we have already
computerized.  As noted in the FAQ on data release, our policy on adequate
proofing before release is firm.  This is an arduous process under the best
of conditions.  Once again examples may help.  When we have all the games for
a league for a season, then we generate the yearly totals for each player and
compare them with a custom program to the official totals.  A typical season
in the 1970s will have over 700 discrepancies between batters and the official
totals in each league and about 350 pitcher differences.  Those numbers
reflect any difference from the official totals for one player in one category.
There are many causes of these differences: mistakes in the scoresheet, errors
by the translator or inputter, or incorrect information in the official record.
The reality is not quite as bad as the numbers make it appear, since many of
the discrepancies are reciprocal.  For example, in the mid-1960s the Orioles
had both Bob Johnson and Davey Johnson play second base.  Several of the games
were entered into the computer with the wrong player.  This happened because
early in the season they only had one Johnson on the roster, so the scorer did
not indicate “D.Johnson” or “B.Johnson” as he did after the second one arrived
from the minors.  As a result one of the Johnsons had too many games, at bats,
hits, runs, doubles, etc in our files when compared to the official totals and
the other Johnson had the corresponding shortfall.  When the files were edited
to get the right Johnson in the right games, then all of those discrepancies
were resolved at once, probably 20 or so.  We always end up with a few dozen
differences that we cannot reconcile with the official totals.  Our starting
assumption is always that the official numbers are correct and that we made a
mistake.  For those which we cannot find an error in our work, we make a note
of the discrepancy and explain why we are leaving our files as they are.  A
list of these disagreements is published with the data files for that year.
At this point, these discrepancy lists have only been posted for a few seasons,
but others are in the works and will be available as soon as we get them into
proper shape.
<p>
So, how can volunteers help with the proofing?  All the full seasons, that is
those for which we have all the games, have been completed or are under their
final review.  The problem for the partial seasons is that we cannot do the
comparison of full season totals, since our files are missing some games.
There are two choices for proceeding.
1. Generate box scores from our files for the games that we do have and then
proof  those against newspaper box scores.  This is very tedious and subject
to mistakes as all the comparisons are made by visual inspection.  It is also
the case that newspaper box scores (remember that these are all pre-1974 games)
did not routinely list many categories we have come to expect, such as caught
stealing, grounded into double play, walks and strikeouts for batters.  In
addition, pinch-runners and pinch-hitters were often not marked that way if
the players stayed in the game and went into the field.  Of course, the
newspaper box scores were far from error-free, so we can end up trying to
track down differences that aren’t really there.  However, this kind of
proofing is something which can be done by anyone in any location with access
to old newspapers on microfilm.  Many public libraries have extensive holdings
of  the New York Times, and this has been a helpful contribution from several
volunteers.
2. Retrosheet is fortunate to have microfilmed copies of the official daily
statistics for both leagues for many seasons.  This information can be taken
from the film and used to create a daily log in a spreadsheet for all official
categories for the players who appeared in the games that we are missing.
Totals can then be easily generated for these players and combined with the
numbers from the games for which we do have the play by play data.  The net
result is computerized season totals that can be used for comparison to the
official numbers, just as we have done for the complete seasons.  This is not
for the faint-hearted, since the image quality of these films varies enormously
and the data format was not consistent over the years either.  We have not
followed this option very often although there would be great value in having
the daily logs computerized.  It may be possible to scan the daily film and
generate electronic images, which would allow this work to be done at home
and not a library (or other source of a microfilm reader), but that option
has not been explored in detail yet.
<p>
There is one final area to address, which is that many people who are
interested in Retrosheet and our data files are highly skilled computer
professionals, representing a broad range of skills.  Several have volunteered
to help with programming, analysis, and other computer-related work with our
files.  Additional analytic software has been written by others to process our
data, but we do not include links to that work, since we believe that at this
time it is best for the web site to be kept as simple as possible.  However,
some of these “third party” efforts have been posted to the RetroList, or at
least described there with details on how to contact the author.  Everyone
appreciates the way that this sharing has taken place and interested
individuals should check the RetroList to see what has been done.

<i>What player's running speed sometimes is a good description for the pace
at which Retrosheet gets things done?</i>
<p>
Cecil Fielder would be a good candidate. Keep in mind that we are an all volunteer
organization and that many of us have real jobs and families that demand a lot of
our time. Remember that Cecil managed to get around the bases to score a lot of runs,
and that it was not unusual for him to knock one out of the park so he could take
all the time he needed to circle the sacks. We hope the success of Retrosheet has
enjoyed makes the last analogy quite appropriate.
