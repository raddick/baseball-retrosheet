<H2>Lost Home Runs</H2>
<P>Through the years, many batters have hit home runs that do not appear as part 
of their record. Most of these apparent homers were lost due to inclement 
weather conditions such as rain-outs. However, there have been quite a few 
four-baggers that have been ultimately credited as some other event in the 
record of the game due to human error on the field. Base-runners and umpires 
account for most of these errors. 
<P>The following is an incomplete list of home runs that were lost for one 
reason or another. Go to those affected by <A 
href="https://www.retrosheet.org/losthr.htm#Weather">weather</A>; go to those 
lost due to <A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/losthr.htm#Other">other 
causes</A>; go to those from the <A

<P>5/29/1913: Art Devlin hit a home run in a game against Brooklyn in Boston 
with a man on base. This blast came in the second inning but was lost to 
rain.

<p>7/21/1916: Brooklyn was rained out in Pittsburgh in the fourth inning. Billy Hinchman of the Pirates smashed a solo homer in the bottom of the third off Jack Coombs. In the bottom of the first frame, Max Carey was ejected by Al Orth over a call at first base.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1922/B08040BSN1922.htm">8/4/1922</A>: 
Ray Powell of the Braves hit an inside-the-park home run in the bottom of the ninth inning
but the inning was wiped out when they could not finish. The rain made play impossible and the game reverted
back to the end of the eighth inning with the Pirates winning, 3-0.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1924/B07310NY11924.htm">7/31/1924</A>: 
Kiki Cuyler lost a home run when a game was rained out and
the score reverted back to the previous inning. The Pirates were playing
in New York when the storm appeared in the third inning. The Giants,
behind 5-0 at this point, started stalling to try to prevent the game
from becoming official. In the top of the seventh, Cuyler homered into
the lower right field seats off Jack Bentley. However, the game was
called after a 30-minute rain delay in the bottom of the frame and the
seventh inning was wiped off the books.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1925/B05160DET1925.htm">5/16/1925</A>:
With the Yankees playing in Detroit, Earle Combs hit a solo homer into the right field
bleachers off Ed Wells to lead off the top of the ninth inning. Wells had just entered
the game. However, with two out in the bottom of the frame, home plate umpire Brick
Owens stopped the game due to the weather conditions, since there lightning and thunder
in the area and the sky had grown dark due to the storm. Combs lost what would have been
his first major league dinger to the poor conditions. Eleven other batters' statistics
were affected by the loss of the ninth inning.

<P>6/29/1925: 
Giant Travis Jackson homered to lead off the bottom of the second 
inning at the Polo Grounds off Bill Ryan of Boston. The game was halted later in 
the half-inning and then cancelled by Umpire Bill Klem because of the field 
conditions after a heavy rain.

<P>7/9/1925: St. Louis Brown player-manager George Sisler homered into the right 
field bleachers at home off the Yankees' Herb Pennock. The blow came in the 
first inning with one man on base. The game was rained out in the fourth inning. 

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1925/B07150PHI1925.htm">7/15/1925</A>:
Tommy Griffith of the Cubs homered off Johnny Couch in 
Philadelphia with one out and no one on in the seventh inning. The bottom of 
that inning was not completed and the game called because of rain so the score 
reverted back to the previous inning and Griffith's home run was eliminated. 

<P>7/22/1925: In a game at Philadelphia both the Phillies' Lew Fonseca and the 
Pirates' Pie Traynor lost homers to the rain. Fonseca hit a solo shot off Vic 
Aldridge in the second inning. Traynor's blast came in the third with a man 
aboard. The game was called in the bottom of the fifth with the Bucs ahead 7-3. 

<p>10/4/1925: Al Simmons of the Athletics smacked a solo homer off Dutch Ruether
in Washington in the top of the fourth inning. The game was washed out after
the Senators batted in the bottom of that frame.

<p>6/23/1926: The Phillies and the Giants attempted to play a doubleheader at the
Polo Grounds but rain washed it out. The Phils had scored five runs in the first
inning, including a three-run homer by George Harper off Virgil Barnes.

<P>6/21/1928: Babe Ruth hit his 26th home run of the season in the first inning 
of game two at Yankee Stadium. This two-run blast tied the game with the 
Philadelphia Athletics, 2-2. Philadelphia scored again in the top of the third 
inning but the game was called because of rain and the muddy conditions.

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1928/B06220CHN1928.htm">6/22/1928</A>: 
In the top of the seventh inning at Wrigley Field, the Cardinals 
scored two runs on a homer by Jim Bottomley to take a 6-1 lead over the Cubs on 
Ladies Day. However, rain stopped the game during the top half of that frame and 
the score reverted back to the last complete inning, so Bottomley lost his 
sixteenth home run of the season.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1932/B06010CHN1932.htm">6/1/1932</A>:
The Cardinals beat the Cubs, 1-0, at Wrigley Field in a seven-inning,
rain-shortened game. Pepper Martin and Eddie Delker both homered in the top
of the eighth inning but lost them when the game was called and the score
reverted to the seventh inning. Delker was 0 for his last 18 at the time
of the homer and had never slugged a four-bagger in the majors at the time.
 
<P>6/28/1933: Roy Johnson of the Red Sox hit a solo shot off Bump Hadley of the 
Browns in the top of the fourth inning. The ball landed on the roof of 
Sportsmans Park. That shot gave the Sox a 4-3 lead but the game was washed out 
after four innings.

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1934/B05290PHA1934.htm">5/29/1934</A>:
In the top of the eighth, Dick Porter and Rick Ferrell of Red Sox hit homers.
However, before the inning was over, heavy rains came, and after a 44 minute wait
the game called. The score after seven innings was 2-1 in favor of the Red Sox,
so that was how the game ended.

<p>6/12/1934: Babe Ruth homered at Yankee Stadium off Bobo Newsom of the
St. Louis Browns. The drive came in the fourth inning to start the scoring
for the home team. After the frame, the Yankees led, 3-1, but rain washed
out the remainder of the contest. This would have been Ruth's tenth home
run of the season. Debs Garms of the Browns also had hit a homer before the
game was terminated. 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1935/B05290WS11935.htm">5/29/1935</A>:
The Yankees scored three runs in the top of the seventh against the Senators. In the
bottom of the inning Jake Powell hit a homer. The rain, which had started to fall
earlier, became so hard that the game could not be continued. The score reverted
back to the end of the sixth inning and 7-4 New York win.
 
<P>6/16/1935: Lou Gehrig and Frank Crosetti each lost a homer because of rain. 
As part of a seven-run fourth inning in the first game of a scheduled 
doubleheader, Crosetti hit his shot off Ted Lyons with one on. Gehrig's drive 
came as the first batter to face Leslie Tietje, also with one man on base.

<p>6/6/1937: Al Simmons of the Senators hit a grand slam in the top of the
first inning in the second game at Cleveland. The contest was washed out
after three innings.
 
<P>8/21/1937: Jimmie Foxx led off the bottom of the second inning with a homer 
off Jimmy DeShong that cleared the left field wall and the street behind Fenway 
Park. It was the only run that the Red Sox scored in four innings as the 
Senators were winning, 5-1, when umpire George Moriarty called the game due to a 
torrential downpour.

<p>5/27/1939: Hank Greenberg of the Tigers hit a two-run home run off Browns
pitcher George Gill in the bottom of the third inning. The game was rained
out after 3-1/2 innings with Detroit leading 4-3.

<p>5/21/1940: Frankie Hayes of the Athletics hit a grand slam off Browns pitcher
Bob Harris in the top of the fifth inning. The game was rained out after 4-1/2
innings with Philadelphia leading 6-0.

<p>6/15/1945: The second game of the Dodgers and Braves double header in Boston
was rained out after three innings. In the second, Chuck Workman had homered off
of Tom Seats. The game was tied 3-3 when it was called.

<p>8/26/1947: In the top of the second of the second game of a doubleheader,
Clyde McCullough of the Cubs hit a home run off of Giants hurler Sheldon Jones.
The game was rained out in the bottom of the inning with the Cubs ahead 1-0. 

<P>8/29/1947: Cleveland's Hank Edwards hit a two run homer with no one out in 
the bottom of the first inning of a game at Municipal Stadium. The game was 
stopped four batters later because of rain. 

<P>9/21/1947: Three home runs were lost due to a rainout in Detroit. The 
Indians' Joe Gordon and Les Fleming hit back-to-back shots to lead off the 
second inning off Hal Newhouser. Vic Wertz of the Tigers had hit a
run blast in the first off Don Black. Those were the only runs when the game was 
stopped in the top of the fourth. 

<P>5/12/1948: Joe DiMaggio hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the first 
inning at Yankee Stadium off Gene Bearden of the Indians. There was one out at the time. The 
game was rained out in the bottom of the fourth.

<p>6/26/1949: Dino Restelli of the Pirates lost a home run during Game Two of the
June 26, 1949 Brooklyn at Pittsburgh doubleheader. The game was cancelled due to
rain and the curfew after three innings. Restelli had hit a home run in the
first inning off of Rex Barney. The game was delayed by rain in the second
inning and then stopped with the Dodgers leading 5-4 after three innings.
The Pennsylvania Sunday curfew law prohibited any inning from beginning
after 6:45 pm (or any play after 7:00 pm).

<P>7/27/1949: Three homers were lost in a rain-shortened game at Yankee Stadium. 
In the bottom of the first, Tommy Henrich homered off Cleveland's Bob Feller 
with two on and no one out. In the top of the second, Joe Gordon hit a solo shot 
with one out off Ed Lopat. One inning later, Cleveland pitcher Sam Zoldak also 
hit a solo homer with one out off Lopat. 
<P>7/29/1949: Ralph Kiner hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the first 
inning at Forbes Field before 30,000 fans. In the top of the fourth a heavy 
downpour halted play with two outs and the 2-0 lead still intact for the 
Pirates. That would have been Kiner's 28th homer of the season in the year that 
he hit 54.
 
<P>8/28/1949: Larry Doby of the Indians homered off Boston's Joe Dobson in the 
bottom of the third inning with two out and no one on. The game was called in 
the top of the fourth because of darkness. It was the second game of a double
header after the first game took over three hours with a long rain delay. 

<P>7/24/1950: In a game that had been rescheduled from 5/10 due to rain in 
Pittsburgh, Eddie Waitkus lost a home run. In the top of the seventh inning with 
the Pirates ahead, 2-1, the Phillies rallied to take the lead as Waitkus hit a 
two-run shot with two outs. There had been a 34-minute rain delay at the end of 
the second inning and after the homer, the game was delayed for an hour and two 
minutes before it was called. According to the rules, the score reverted back to 
the end of the sixth inning since the lead had changed and the home team had not 
had its turn at bat in the inning. Thus all events in the top of the seventh 
were eliminated.

<P>8/29/1950: Tommy Byrne, a Yankee pitcher, hit a home run in the bottom of the 
second inning of the second game of a scheduled doubleheader. It came with 1 on 
and 1 out off Sam Zoldak and put the Yanks ahead 4 to 0. In the bottom of the 
third, the game was called because of rain. 

<p><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1950/B09100PHI1950.htm">9/10/1950</A>:
The Phillies' Jackie Mayo homered in the bottom of the sixth 
inning before the game was called due to rain. Since the sixth inning had not 
been completed, the score (and stats) reverted back to the previous full inning 
because the lost homer left the Phillies still trailing, by a score of 3-2. 

<P>5/23/1951: The Tigers were ahead 7-3 at Yankee Stadium when the game 
was washed out in the top of the fourth. Both Bud Souchock and Joe DiMaggio lost homers. 

<P>6/1/1951: Vic Wertz led off the bottom of the second in Detroit with a shot 
off Allie Reynolds. Johnny Mize homered to lead off the Yankee fourth against 
Virgil Trucks. The game was rained out after 4 1/2 innings. 

<P>8/25/1951: At the Polo Grounds two batters had homers rained out. Bobby 
Thomson homered off Cardinal Al Brazle with one out in the second inning and 
Stan Musial hit one off Al Corwin to lead off the third inning. 
<P>6/21/1952: Steve Souchock of the Tigers lost a two-run homer to the rain. The 
game against the Athletics was called in the bottom of the fourth. 
<P>8/2/1952: Hank Sauer hit a homer at Brooklyn in the third inning with two on 
base. The pitcher was Ben Wade. The game was rained out in the fifth inning. 
Sauer ended the season tied for the home run lead with Ralph Kiner with 37. 
<P>5/12/1953: Carlos Bernier of the Pirates led off the top of the second inning 
with a homer off Cincinnati's Eddie Erautt for the first run of the game. With 
one out in the bottom of the fifth and the Pirates ahead, 5-1, the game was 
rained out. Bernier hit three homers in his career. 

<P><A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1953/B08030MLN1953.htm">8/3/1953</A>: 
Duke Snider lost a homer to the rain in Milwaukee. The blow came as 
he led off the eighth inning with Lew Burdette pitching for the Braves. The game 
was called with the Dodgers leading 2-0 during the bottom of the eighth. The records
reverted back to the end of the seventh and a 1-0 Dodgers win.

<p>4/20/1955: Felipe Montemayor of the Pirates hit a three-run home run
(which would have been his first major league homer) off Giants pitcher Ruben Gomez
in the bottom of the third inning. The game was rained out in the top of the
fourth inning with Pittsburgh leading 3-0.

<p>4/24/1955: In the second game of a scheduled double-header, Dee Fondy and
Harry Chiti of the Cubs both hit home runs off Reds pitcher Corky Valentine

<P>9/23/1880: Worcester's pitcher Fred Corey hit an inside-the-park homer 
against Boston but failed to touch third base and was credited with a double.

<p>9/17/1881: For the second time, Worcester's Fred Corey, playing right field, lost a
homer when he failed to touch third. This time it was against Cleveland in
the ninth inning of a 7-2 win. These would have been the first two homers
in his career, which ended up with a total of seven.

<P>6/23/1883: Jerry Denny of Providence (NL) hit the ball out of the playing
field, but he failed to touch third base and was called out.

<p>8/1/1883: Chick Fulmer of the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association lost a home run in the first inning. Fulmer failed to touch 3B while running out his four-bagger against the Columbus Buckeyes and was out on appeal. In the fourth inning, Fulmer successfully completed a circuit for an inside-the-park homer. The game was played in Cincinnati.

<p>7/2/1884: Bid McPhee of the Cincinnati Reds (AA) hit an inside-the-park home run at League Park in Cincinnati. However, he was out on appeal for failing to touch 2B.

<p>7/12/1884: Billy Sunday homered in the eighth inning for the Chicago White Stockings at Detroit. However, he failed to touch second and was called out.

<p>9/15/1887: The NY Giants were in Chicago playing the White Stockings (now Cubs). Jim O'Rourke was listed twice in the batting order. The first was “O'Rourke or Brown, catcher” and the second was “Nelson or O'Rourke, third base.” In the second inning, O'Rourke was out at 1B batting out of order but nothing was said. In the fourth, he hit a home run into the carriages beyond the outfielders but was called out after Chicago manager Cap Anson appealed to umpire Phil Powers.

<p>9/16/1887: Bob Pettit of Chicago (NL) ran the circuit on a hit but was called out on appeal for missing 3B in the third inning.

<p>6/15/1889: Al Maul of the Alleghenys (Pirates) hit a ball over the LF fence for a home run in Indianapolis. Maul stopped at 3B and did not score because he wanted there to be a base runner. This would make the catcher play closer up to the plate. At the time, catchers would stand farther back behind the batter to make it easier to catch pitches.

<p>5/8/1894: The Boston Beaneaters (Braves) were in New York playing the Giants. In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Giants had two runners on base with no one out when the game was called by darkness. Boston had scored twice in the top of the frame on a single by Jimmy Bannon and a home run by Charlie Ganzel. The score reverted to the end of the seventh inning and Ganzel lost his four-bagger. Those runs did not matter since the home team won, 16-5.

<p>9/8/1897: In the second game of a doubleheader in Washington, Kip Selbach
of the home team bounced a ball into the stands for a home run in the fourth
inning. However, the game was forfeited by Cleveland to Washington in the top
of the fifth inning and the statistics did not count for the contest.

<p>7/10 - 7/12/1890: The Pittsburgh at Boston Players League games were thrown
out because Boston illegally used a player, Gil Hatfield, on loan from the
New York team in the league. There were four homers hit in the three games that
were removed from the official records:
<ul>
<li>7/10: Boston's Hardy Richardson in the second and Dan Brouthers in the eighth
<li>7/11: Richardson in the eighth
<li>7/12: Richardson in the third
</ul>
Richardson also homered, which counted, in his next two games, so he lost a
streak five games.

<p>09/19/1900: Brooklyn's Hughie Jennings had hit a homer in the bottom of
the first against St. Louis. However, in the bottom of the third a dispute
between the Cardinals and the umpire resulted in the game being forfeited.
<A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/forfeits.htm">(See forfeits page for details.)</A>
Since the game had not yet gone long enough to be official, the records did
not count and Jennings' homer was lost.

<P>5/30/1903: In the top of the first, the Phillies had a runner on 1b and two 
out. Bill Keister hit a ball off Henry Schmidt that got past the Brooklyn 
fielders into lcf and he ran all the way around for an IPHR. However, umpire 
Johnson ruled that he cut 2b (not touching it) and Keister ended up with an RBI 
single.

<p>9/24/1903: The first game of the day lasted 11 innings and 2:25. In the top of the sixth of game two, the White Sox scored two runs on a Ducky Holmes homer to tie the game at 7 each. Four batters later, umpire Harry Adams called the game because of darkness with two out and two strikes on Lee Tannehill. The game reverted to the end of the fifth, giving the Athletics a win, 7-5.
 
<P>10/4/1904: In the second game of a doubleheader, Jack Dunn of the Giants
homered. However, he was called out by umpire 
Jim Johnstone for missing first base. This and other protests caused the arbiter 
to forfeit the game to St. Louis.

An over-flow crowd at the Polo Grounds was allowed to ring the outfield with a ground rule that any ball hit into (or over) the crowd would be a double. Bill Dahlen of the Giants hit a ball into the left field bleachers to lead off the bottom of the third inning off Cubs pitcher Jack Taylor. A home run on any other day, due to that day's ground rule, Dahlen was only awarded a double.
 
<P>10/2/1912:
At a game in Chicago the Pirates were leading 5-4 in the bottom of 
the ninth inning. Catcher Jimmy Archer, batting in the eighth spot in the 
lineup, doubled. Cy Williams ran for Archer and Wilbur Good pinch hit for Jimmy 
Lavender. Hank Robinson replaced Howie Camnitz on the mound and Dick Cotter was 
sent up to bat for Good. Cotter singled in the tying run, sending the game into 
the tenth inning, and took Archer's place as catcher. In the bottom of the 
tenth, Chicago had runners on first and second with two out and the eighth place 
in the lineup due to bat. Cotter came to the plate and singled to center to 
drive in the winning run. After the players had left the field Pirate manager 
Fred Clarke realized that Cotter had batted out of turn and sent the team's secretary to umpire 
Brick Owens to protest. Owens told the Pirates that it was too late for a 
protest since the team had left the playing field. However, NL President Tom 
Lynch upheld the protest on 10/13 and threw the game out. It was not replayed or 
completed. In the game there were two homers hit that are not part of the 
player's record. Frank Schulte hit a two-run shot off Camnitz with one out in 
the sixth which tied the game at 4. Chief Wilson hit his blast leading off the 
eighth off Lavender.

However, as he rounded third base, manager Larry Schlafly, who was coaching third, patted Bonin on the back. Bonin was declared out by the umpires. This would have been Bonin's only home run in his 21-game major league career. He was credited with a triple, the only one of his career!

In the top of the fourth inning of a game in Chicago, Washington's 
Frank Ellerbe was on first base with two outs. Patsy Gharrity hit the ball into 
the left field bleachers for an apparent two-run homer. When Ellerbe heard the 
fans in those seats cheering he thought Joe Jackson had caught the ball which 
would have ended the inning. After rounding third base, Ellerbe turned and went 
to his shortstop position. Meanwhile Gharrity trotted around the bases. When he 
rounded third base, he was called out for passing Ellerbe. Both umpires, Bill 
Dinneen and Ollie Chill, made the call. Washington argued that since the ball was 
out of play it did not make any difference that Gharrity passed Ellerbe. The 
headline in the next days' <I>New York Times</I> read: "Gharrity's Homer Retires 
His Side." This event had no effect on the game as the Senators beat the White 
Sox, 5-0.

The Tigers were in Washington for a strange game. In the top of 
the first inning, Harry Heilmann homered into the left field bleachers. It came 
off Harry Courtney with one runner on base. However, Heilmann was called out for 
batting out of turn by umpire Billy Evans. Detroit manager Ty Cobb had changed 
the lineup before the game but did not tell the players. Bobby Veach was skipped 
in the batting order in the initial frame. Veach batted in the fourth inning for 
the first time and homered to right field. In the fifth inning, Washington's 
Bucky Harris was called out on the base paths because of interference by Clyde 
Milan who was coaching third base at the time. There was a lot of confusion on 
the field during that play and eventually Harris and Sam Rice ended up standing 
at third base. When Rice stepped off the bag he was tagged out.

Babe Ruth hit a homer into the right fields stands at the Polo 
Grounds in the sixth inning and should have had another. In the fourth inning, 
the Babe hit another long fly to right which would have cleared the fence. 
However, a fan reached out over the fence to catch the ball. Home plate umpire 
Tommy Connolly consulted with base umpire Ollie Chill and they ruled the ball a 
double. Ruth was already at third and returned to second only after a long 
argument.

It was the bottom of the tenth in the first game of a Memorial Day doubleheader 
in Philadelphia. Butch Henline of the Phils batted with the score tied and runners 
on 1b and 3b. He hit the ball into the lf bleachers for a game-ending homer. 
However, after Tilly Walker scored from 3b, Henline stopped at 2b. Thus he gave 
up a homer for a double. Considering he only hit 40 home runs in his career it 
should have been a bigger deal. Maybe winning the game was enough (what a 
concept!)

out. The drive came off Watty Clark with no one on and one out. 

<P>6/6/1937(2):
Joe Medwick of the Cardinals lost a homer in the second game of a 
doubleheader against the Phillies in Philadelphia. He had hit what would have 
been his tenth homer of the season in the first inning and St. Louis was leading 
8-2 in the top of the fourth. An 88 minute rain delay in the first game delayed 
the start of game two and the 7 o'clock closing law was approaching. The Phils 
started stalling by making unnecessary pitching changes, mound conferences and 
asking for different balls. Eventually umpire Bill Klem forfeited the game to 
the Redbirds and all stats were wiped out because the game failed to go five 
innings. Manager Jimmie Wilson was later fined $100 by Ford Fick for his 
stalling tactics. Medwick was still able to win the triple-crown in that year

third base for a triple. After the ninth inning ended with the teams tied at 5-5, Reds manager Bill McKechnie announced that he
was protesting the game based on that call in the sixth inning. The Cardinals had scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth
to tie the game. The Reds scored once in the top of the tenth but the Redbirds won the contest with two in the bottom of the
frame. NL president Ford Frick upheld the protest on June 3 and declared the game a tie. He also awarded Cooke with a homer, so it became "unlost." The teams replayed the game on

pitching change, a walk and a fly out, the umpires stopped the game in the middle of an at bat by Joe Medwick.
The game reverted back to a nine-inning, 1-1 tie. The contest was scheduled for a September 6 makeup. This was the

The Cubs were at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh to play the Pirates. They lost their eighth consecutive game by a score of 4-1 as the Pirates 
gathered ten hits, all singles, to score their runs. Meanwhile, the Cubs were hitting the ball all over the yard without much to show for it. Frank 
Thomas hit two long flies that were caught in the spacious ballpark and Dick Gernert hit another. In the top of the third, Jerry Kindall hit a fly ball off the clock in left

Clete Boyer homered off Cleveland's Jim Perry in Yankee Stadium in the sixth 
inning of the second game of a Sunday afternoon doubleheader. The ball hit in 
the far left hand corner of the lower level of the grandstand and bounced back 
onto the playing field. Home plate umpire Joe Linsalata signalled it a homer and 
immediately Jimmy Piersall ran out of the visitor's bullpen in left field. 
Piersall contended that the ball was in play and two umpires agreed with him 
(Frank Umont at third and Charlie Berry at second). Boyer, already in his home 
run trot, was tagged out at third base, receiving credit for a double and two 
runs batted in. The game was protested by the Yankees. Earlier in the game, 
Mickey Mantle hit his 53rd home run of the season. In the first game, Piersall 
fought with a fan who came onto the field.

Met Ron Swoboda lost a grand slam at Crosley Field in Cincinnati. In the first 
inning, after a single, double and intentional walk, Swoboda hit a long drive to 
center field off John Tsitouris. At that time, there was a double fence; the 
main wall was concrete and it was topped with a plywood extension to protect the 
road construction crew outside. The concrete was in play while the plywood was a 
homer; Swoboda's ball hit the plywood and bounced back. Vada Pinson threw the 
ball back to the infield; second base umpire Frank Secory ruled that the ball 
was in play. The slam turned into a 1 RBI single. Coach Yogi Berra was ejected 
for arguing the call for the first time in his National League career. After the 
game he uttered one of his classic lines: "Anyone who can't hear the difference 
between wood and concrete must be blind."

May, running at first, hesitated, then started back to first base. Buford passed 
him and May was called out while Buford circled the bases. A five minute

Buford was credited with a run scoring single, and May with a run scored, even 
though those events never actually happened on the field. Home plate umpire Red

loaded in the bottom of the ninth and the Brewers behind the Yankees 9-6. Before 
Dave Pagan delivered his second pitch to Money, New York manager Billy Martin 
yelled to first baseman Chris Chambliss to call time. Chambliss asked umpire Jim 
McKean. Money hit the pitch and circled the bases. The Brewers celebrated and 
went into the clubhouse thinking they had won for the second time in two games. 
However, before Money crossed the plate Martin was on the field arguing with 
McKean. After a couple of minutes of Martin's tirade, the umpires sent for the 
Brewers to come back on the field. The Brewers were obviously upset about the 
call. First base coach Harvey Keunn said that the pitcher was already in his 
motion when Chambliss yelled for time. Some Brewers went so far as to say that 
Martin intimidated McKean into reversing the homer. The Yankees won the game,

In the first inning in Milwaukee, Mark McGwire hit his 65th home run of the 
season. In the fifth inning, McGwire hit a ball to the wall in left-center 
field. A fan touched the ball and McGwire was given a double on the

the fence if the fan had not touched it.

ruled a double. 
<P><A 
href="https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1999/B10170NYN1999.htm">10/17/1999</A>: In 
game 5 of the NL Championship Series, the Braves had taken a 3-2 lead in the top 
of the 15th inning. However, after an one-out intentional walk to load the 
bases, Todd Pratt walked to push across the tying run for the Mets. Robin 
Ventura came to the plate with a chance to win the game. Ventura hit a Kevin 
McGlinchy pitch over the right-centerfield fence for an apparent game-ending 
grand slam. However, once each baserunner had advanced one base, thus scoring 
the winning run, Pratt turned and ran towards Ventura to give him a big hug. 
Ventura had rounded first base and was advancing towards second in his home run 
trot. He kept motioning to the other runners to keep running. Since each runner 
only advanced the one bag, Ventura is officially credited with an RBI-single. It 
would have been the first game-ending grand slam in the history of post-season.

Richard Hidalgo homered into the right-centerfield bullpen in the bottom of the 
fifth inning. The ball caromed off an inner fence back onto the field and was 
ruled in play. Hidalgo had to settle for a triple. In each of the previous two 
games, Hidalgo had hit two homers. With the homer he had hit in the second 
inning, this lost blast would have made three consecutive games with multiple 
homers.

realizing that the Long had not held the ball started to tag up
and passed Tucker going back to first. 
Tucker was called out for passing the runner; he lost a homer but was credited 
with an RBI-single that gave the Royals a 4-3 victory over the Athletics.

In the top of the 9th the Boston Red Sox were behind one run in a game at Tampa 
Bay. Left fielder David McCarty hit a home run into the left field stands. 
Umpire Joe West ruled fan interference and called him out on it, saying that 
Tampa Bay's left fielder Carl Crawford could have made the catch. Replays 
clearly showed it was a home run at least 2 feet into the stands. That would 
have tied the score but the Sox lost 5-4.

left the field and after a consultation among the crew the call was upheld and 
Kapler ended up with a double. Trot Nixon, on the disabled list, was ejected 
from the dugout after the call. The lost dinger didn't matter in the game as 
Boston beat Texas, 16-5.

first base and was out on a double play. After the game, Boston manager Terry Francona said: "It's like
playing putt-putt golf where you've got to go around the windmill. That's embarrassing. The outcome of the
game should never, never hinge on a speaker." The Twins completed a three-game sweep of the Red Sox, 5-3.

Kevin Youkilis of the Red Sox hit a blast to left field off Devil Rays pitcher Tim Corcoran in the top of the third inning which hit one of Tropicana Field's "B-ring" catwalks.

umpires. After having homered in the third, in the bottom of the sixth Alex Rodriguez hit of line shot to
right center off of Lance Cormier that cleared the fence, but bounced back into the field off of a set of
stairs above the fence painted yellow. Orioles right field Nick Markakis played the ball and threw to second
where Rodriguez was standing. Immediately after the play, Rodriguez pointed to the stairs and said the ball
had hit there. After a brief consultation the umpires ruled the ball had bounced back from the top of the
fence, so the hit became a double. However, replays showed the ball cleared the fence by a couple of feet.
