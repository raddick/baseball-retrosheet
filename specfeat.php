<h2>Special Features</h2>
<p>
Here are links to some items that do not fit nicely elsewhere on the site.
There also may be links to them from other pages where you might not think to
look for them.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.retrosheet.org/Regional Series">Regional/City Series</a>. An extensive section
about postseason series sanctioned by organized baseball played from 1905-42, mostly in Chicago. There
are boxscores for all 190 of the games in the 32 series, and the vast majority have play-by-play accounts, some deduced. Over 20 years of research by Mike Cantor is the basis of this section about an overlooked part of baseball's history. Also, there are descriptions of other series dating back to 1882 in article by the late Fred Ivor-Campbell.

<li>Charlie Pavitt has compiled an extensive bibliography (over 3000 entries) of "Sabrmetric" research papers (updated in September 2022):

leagues and divisions, and their most common nicknames.

<LI>Walter LeConte has developed a list of exhibition games played by major league teams during
the regular season. He has generously provided us with the fruits of his efforts. His articles and

[Last updated: Jan. 2002; since we no longer publish a newsletter, this list may 
be updated very infrequently if at all] There is no end to the unbelievable 
plays that can happen in a game or during a season. As we process scoresheets, 
we run across many of them. How about a strikeout with the batter being out 767? 
It actually happened, and you can read about it here. These plays are compiled 
from newsletter starting with Vol. 3, No. 3. The earlier newsletters also have some 
incredible plays, and orginally we called them Odd and Cute. Choose the News 
link to visit the page with the newsletters if you want to browse them.
