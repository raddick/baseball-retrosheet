<H2>Game Collections</H2>

In addition to <a href=./allstargames.html>All-Star Games</a> and <a href=./championships.html>Postseason Championship Series</a>, Retrosheet has compiled some other sets of games that users may find interesting. Games which satisfy the various criteria outlined below are available for viewing and/or downloading at the links below.
<br><br>

<i>This page would become a merger of various existing pages: Playoff Games, No-Hitters and Cycles, and most (if not all) of the 'Noteworthy Events' and 'Special Features' items of the current 'Features' menu item. It would also absorb the last nine bullets on the 'Notable Negro League Baseball Games' page - some of these would end up merging with some of the above pages (No-Hitters, Triple Plays, Cycles); some could be expanded to also include AL/NL games that meet these criteria (High-K Games, Multi-HR Games, 20+ Inning Games).</i><br><br>

<i>These will all eventually be links. The list here isn't necessarily exhaustive. The idea here is that one can identify whether a game qualifies for a group based on the game file. So, to create a set of games all we have to do is do a search across all of our game files. Easy-peasy.</i>

Tiebreaker Playoffs<br>
No-Hitters<br>
Cycles<br>
Triple Plays<br>
3+ HR Games (by a single player)<br>
18+ K by a Pitcher <i>pick whatever # you'd like here</i><br>
20+ Inning Games<br>
Games Played Outside the U.S. and Canada <i>Negro League teams played a few games in Canada. We may want to include these and just exclude games hosted by the Expos and Blue Jays.</i><br>
SABR Games <i>This one isn't directly identifiable from game files; we'd need a list from SABR.</i><br>
<br>

<b><a href=https://www.retrosheet.org/lists.htm>Additional Noteworthy Events</a></b>

<br><br>

Retrosheet has compiled additional lists of some of the rarer or noteworthy things that have taken place during major league baseball's colorful history. These lists can be found at the link above. (This links to Retrosheet's former "Lists of Noteworthy Events" under previous menu item 'Features' - 'Noteworthy Events'.)
