<b><font size="3">First National Association Game</font></b>
<br><br>
Retrosheet is proud to present the details of the first
Major League game ever played, a National Association contest
between the Cleveland Forest Cities and Ft. Wayne Kekiongas on
May 4, 1871.  The basic play by play information was gathered
by Bob Tiemann, who graciously donated it to Retrosheet.  Andy
Singer, a very knowledgeable researcher on 19th century baseball,
did the actual computerization.  Bob made available many more
games than this and work is underway to get them computerized.
However, the special nature of this game demanded that it be
presented now.
<br><br>
Some comments are in order.  In 1871, the home team would
often bat in the bottom of the 9th inning, even if they were ahead.
Ft. Wayne did choose to do so on this day, while leading 2-0.
Of course, the home team could in fact choose to bat first, which
did happen on occasion, although not here.  Then there is the
matter of determining which batter leads off an inning.  The rule
was that the man after the one who made the last out would lead
off the next inning.  Hypothetical inning: Batter A walks, Batter
B strikes out, Batter C strikes out, and Batter D hits into a force
play, with Batter A being retired at second base.  The first
batter in the next inning is Batter B! He is literally "the next
batter after the one who made the last out".  There were no cases
of this situation in this game.  Our software needs some adjustments
to deal with these very unusual (by modern standards) conditions.
It is also true that batters were out on foul balls which were 
caught on a bounce.  There were 3 occurrences of this type of out 
in this game.  Andy Singer has very kindly prepared a Word document
with the <A href="https://www.retrosheet.org/1871Rules.doc">1871 rules</A> which make fascinating reading.
<br><br>
Gary Hull provided weather data for that day. The observations were
taken about 1 mile outside Ft. Wayne and are included in the expanded
box score.
<br><br>
What follows below are the full play by play of this historic
game along with a modern style expanded box score and a more
conventional newspaper style box score.  That is, conventional
for the second half of the 20th century, but not for 1871!
