Cecil Fielder would be a good candidate. Keep in mind that we are an all volunteer
organization and that many of us have real jobs and families that demand a lot of
our time. Remember that Cecil managed to get around the bases to score a lot of runs,
and that it was not unusual for him to knock one out of the park so he could take
all the time he needed to circle the sacks. We hope the success of Retrosheet has
enjoyed makes the last analogy quite appropriate.
