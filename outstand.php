<h2>Outstanding Feats</h2>
<p>
Here are lists of some of the game's most notable achievements. They are
not rare or unusual, but they are not all that common. Typically there
are at most a few each season. In some cases, we know the lists are not
complete. If you know of instances we have not shown, please let us know.
You can do that by sending e-mail to "tthress-ATsign-retrosheet.org".
