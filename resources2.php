<b>Websites Using Retrosheet Data</b>
<br><br>

Many baseball fans and researchers have made use of Retrosheet data as part of the work which they display elsewhere on the Internet. We thought that these might be of interest to Retrosheet users and so we list them here. If you are aware of another website which may be of interest to Retrosheet users, please let us know at the e-mail address shown below.

<br><br>

<ul>
<li><a href=https://www.baseball-reference.com/>Baseball Reference</a>: A comprehensive compendium of baseball statistics</li>
<br>
<li><a href=https://baseball.tomthress.com/>Baseball Player Won-Lost Records</a>: Retrosheet President Tom Thress has constructed measures of player wins and losses using Retrosheet's play-by-play data</li>
<br>
</ul>

<i>At some point in the next month or two, I plan to put out a request for candidate websites to link here.</i>
